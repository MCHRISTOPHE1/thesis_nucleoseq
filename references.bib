	abstract = {During the evolution of eukaryotes, a new structural motif arose by the fusion of genes encoding two different types of DNA-binding domain. The family of transcription factors which contain this domain, the POU proteins, have come to play essential roles not only in the development of highly specialised tissues, such as complex neuronal systems, but also in more general cellular housekeeping. Members of the POU family recognise defined DNA sequences, and a well-studied subset have specificity for a motif known as the octamer element which is found in the promoter region of a variety of genes. The structurally bipartite POU domain has intrinsic conformational flexibility and this feature appears to confer functional diversity to this class of transcription factors. The POU domain for which we have the most structural data is from Oct-1, which binds an eight base-pair target and variants of this octamer site. The two-part DNA-binding domain partially encircles the DNA, with the sub-domains able to assume a variety of conformations, dependent on the DNA element. Crystallographic and biochemical studies have shown that the binary complex provides distinct platforms for the recruitment of specific regulators to control transcription. The conformability of the POU domain in moulding to DNA elements and co-regulators provides a mechanism for combinatorial assembly as well as allosteric molecular recognition. We review here the structure and function of the diverse POU proteins and discuss the role of the proteins’ plasticity in recognition and transcriptional regulation.},

High-throughput technologies like ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives methods have greatly enhanced our knowledge of 3D chromatin architecture. However, the chromatin interaction mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Deep learning, with its powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities, offers a promising approach for integrating multi-omics data, to build accurate predictive models of chromatin interaction matrices. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in chromatin interaction matrix prediction models. By integrating DNA sequences and epigenetic signals, we investigate the latest developments in these methods. This article details various models, focusing on how one-dimensional (1D) information transforms into the 3D structure chromatin interactions, and how the integration of different deep learning modules specifically affects model accuracy. Additionally, we discuss the critical role of DNA sequence information and epigenetic markers in shaping 3D genome interaction patterns. Finally, this review addresses the challenges in predicting chromatin interaction matrices, in order to improve the precise mapping of chromatin interaction matrices and DNA sequence, and supporting the transformation and theoretical development of 3D genomics across biological systems.},

In this report, we conducted nucleosome reconstitution experiments in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing on 572 KB of human DNA and 668 KB of mouse DNA that was unmethylated or methylated in order to investigate the effects of this epigenetic modification on the positioning and stability of nucleosomes. The results demonstrated that a subset of nucleosomes positioned by nucleotide sequence was sensitive to methylation where the modification increased the affinity of these sequences for the histone octamer. The features that distinguished these nucleosomes from the bulk of the methylation-insensitive nucleosomes were an increase in the frequency of CpG dinucleotides and a unique rotational orientation of CpGs such that their minor grooves tended to face toward the histones in the nucleosome rather than away. These methylation-sensitive nucleosomes were preferentially associated with exons as compared to introns while unmethylated CpG islands near transcription start sites became enriched in nucleosomes upon methylation. The results of this study suggest that the effects of DNA methylation on nucleosome stability in vitro can recapitulate what has been observed in the cell and provide a direct link between DNA methylation and the structure and function of chromatin.},

	abstract = {We know little about the genomic events that led to the advent of a multicellular grade of organization in animals, one of the most dramatic transitions in evolution. Metazoan multicellularity is correlated with the evolution of embryogenesis, which presumably was underpinned by a gene regulatory network reliant on the differential activation of signaling pathways and transcription factors. Many transcription factor genes that play critical roles in bilaterian development largely appear to have evolved before the divergence of cnidarian and bilaterian lineages. In contrast, sponges seem to have a more limited suite of transcription factors, suggesting that the developmental regulatory gene repertoire changed markedly during early metazoan evolution. Using whole-genome information from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, a range of eumetazoans, and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, we investigate the genesis and expansion of homeobox, Sox, T-box, and Fox transcription factor genes. Comparative analyses reveal that novel transcription factor domains (such as Paired, POU, and T-box) arose very early in metazoan evolution, prior to the separation of extant metazoan phyla but after the divergence of choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that transcription factor classes then gradually expanded at the base of Metazoa before the bilaterian radiation, with each class following a different evolutionary trajectory. Based on the limited number of transcription factors in the Amphimedon genome, we infer that the genome of the metazoan last common ancestor included fewer gene members in each class than are present in extant eumetazoans. Transcription factor orthologues present in sponge, cnidarian, and bilaterian genomes may represent part of the core metazoan regulatory network underlying the origin of animal development and multicellularity.},

Genetic studies confirmed mobility of the latter class of elements in mice, with a high proportion of phenotypic mutations consequent to transposition of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) family of LTR retrotransposons1. Using the mouse genome sequence and an efficient ex vivo retrotransposition assay, we identified functional, master IAP copies that encode all the enzymatic and structural proteins necessary for their autonomous transposition in heterologous cells. By introducing mutations, we found that the three genes gag, prt and pol are all required for retrotransposition and identified the IAP gene products by electron microscopy in the form of intracellular A-type particles in the transfected cells. These prototypic elements, devoid of an envelope gene, are the first LTR retrotransposons autonomous for transposition to be identified in mammals. Their high rates of retrotransposition indicate that they are potent insertional mutagens that could serve as safe (noninfectious) genetic tools in a large panel of cells.},

Particularly, the finding of cell type invariant, evolutionarily conserved topologically associating domains (TADs) in a broad spectrum of cell types has provided a new molecular framework for study of animal development and human diseases.

We determined electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystal structures of unbound and H1-bound nucleosomes and validated these structures by site-directed protein cross-linking and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. Histone H1 shifts the conformational landscape of the nucleosome by drawing the two linkers together and reducing their flexibility. The H1 C-terminal domain (CTD) localizes primarily to a single linker, while the H1 globular domain contacts the nucleosome dyad and both linkers, associating more closely with the CTD-distal linker. These findings reveal that H1 imparts a strong degree of asymmetry to the nucleosome, which is likely to influence the assembly and architecture of higher-order structures.},

The exact locations of nucleosomes along the genome play a critical role in chromosome functions and gene regulation. However, the current methods for nucleosome mapping do not provide the necessary accuracy to identify the precise nucleosome locations. Here we describe a new experimental approach that directly maps nucleosome center locations in vivo genome-wide at single base pair resolution.},

	abstract = {Biochemical and electron microscopic studies demonstrate that the subunit structure of Chinese hamster ovary cell interphase chromatin is conserved in mititic chromosomes. Digestion of purified chromosomes or nuclei with micrococcal nuclease produces DNA in discrete size classes, as visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which are common to the two materials. Early in digestion the DNA fragments are integral multiples of a monomer approximately 177 base pairs in length, whereas after extensive digestion the remaining DNA fragments migrate ahead of the monomer position. The size of the repeating DNA unit was confirmed as being smaller than that produced by micrococcal nuclease digestion of rat liver nuclei by direct comparison. Electron microscopy of partially unravelled chromosomes at low ionic strength shows tightly packed spheres (nucleosomes) approximately 12 nm in diameter which are often arranged as linear chains. Chromosomal material prepared for electron microscopy after varying extents of micrococcal nuclease digestion is composed of fragments containing pregressively fewer nucleosomes, which parallels the loss of high DNA multimer bands in gel electrophoresis. Material unravelled from chromosomes in the presence of NaCl consists of nucleosomes packed packed in a different configuration which suggests the origin of higher order structures in chromosomes.},

Several studies have suggested a role in stabilizing specific 3D genomic contacts. To test this hypothesis, we exploited inter-chromosomal contacts frequencies obtained from Hi-C experiments and show that the folding of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes is associated with a significant co-localization of several specific repetitive elements, notably many elements of the {SINE} family. These repeats tend to be the oldest ones and are enriched in transcription factor binding sites. We propose that the co-localization of these repetitive elements may explain the global conservation of genome folding observed between homologous regions of the human and mouse genome. Taken together, these results support a contribution of specific repetitive elements in maintaining and/or reshaping genome architecture over evolutionary times.},

They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. {CTCF} ({CCCTC}-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used {ChIP}-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of {CTCF} in three cell types and identified significant binding of {CTCF} to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of {CTCF}-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking {CTCF}-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by {CTCF}. Our data indicate that {CTCF} may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the {CTCF} function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

Using an integrated analysis of chromatin remodeler binding and nucleosome occupancy following rapid remodeler depletion, we investigated the interplay between these enzymes and their impact on transcription in yeast. We show that many promoters are affected by multiple {CRs} that operate in concert or in opposition to position the key transcription start site ({TSS})-associated +1 nucleosome. We also show that nucleosome movement after {CR} inactivation usually results from the activity of another {CR} and that in the absence of any remodeling activity, +1 nucleosomes largely maintain their positions. Finally, we present functional assays suggesting that +1 nucleosome positioning often reflects a trade-off between maximizing {RNA} polymerase recruitment and minimizing transcription initiation at incorrect sites.

Although the ability of the 147 base pair sequence to precisely position a nucleosome in vitro is well documented, application of this property in vivo has been explored only in a few studies and yielded contradictory conclusions. Our goal in the present study was to test the ability of the 601 sequence to dictate nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the context of a long tandem repeat array inserted in a yeast chromosome. We engineered such arrays with three different repeat size, namely 167, 197 and 237 base pairs. Although our arrays are able to position nucleosomes in vitro, analysis of nucleosome occupancy in vivo revealed that nucleosomes are not preferentially positioned as expected on the 601-core sequence along the repeats and that the measured nucleosome repeat length does not correspond to the one expected by design. Altogether our results demonstrate that the rules defining nucleosome positions on this {DNA} sequence in vitro are not valid in vivo, at least in this chromosomal context, questioning the relevance of using the 601 sequence in vivo to achieve precise nucleosome positioning on designer synthetic {DNA} sequences.},

Here, we present a strategy for high-resolution nucleosome profiling at selected genomic features, and use this to analyse dynamic nucleosome positioning at inducible and cell-type-specific mammalian promoters. We find that nucleosome patterning at inducible promoters frequently resembles that at active promoters, even before stimulus-driven activation. Accordingly, the nucleosome profile at many inactive inducible promoters is sufficient to predict cell-type-specific responsiveness. Induction of gene expression is generally not associated with major changes to nucleosome patterning, and a subset of inducible promoters can be activated without stable nucleosome depletion from their transcription start sites. These promoters are generally dependent on remodelling enzymes for their inducible activation, and exhibit transient nucleosome depletion only at alleles undergoing transcription initiation. Together, these data reveal how the responsiveness of inducible promoters to activating stimuli is linked to cell-type-specific nucleosome patterning.},

Herein we compare the nucleosome and chromatin targeting activities of Oct4 (POU DBD), Sox2 (HMG box DBD), Klf4 (zinc finger DBD), and c-Myc (bHLH DBD), which together reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. Purified Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 proteins can bind nucleosomes in vitro, and in vivo they preferentially target silent sites enriched for nucleosomes. Pioneer activity relates simply to the ability of a given DBD to target partial motifs displayed on the nucleosome surface. Such partial motif recognition can occur by coordinate binding between factors. Our findings provide insight into how pioneer factors can target naïve chromatin sites.},

One such factor is NeuroD1, which is essential for eliciting the neuronal development program and possesses the ability to reprogram other cell types into neurons. Given this capacity, it is important to understand its targets and the mechanism underlying neuronal specification. Here, we show that NeuroD1 directly binds regulatory elements of neuronal genes that are developmentally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. This targeting is sufficient to initiate events that confer transcriptional competence, including reprogramming of transcription factor landscape, conversion of heterochromatin to euchromatin, and increased chromatin accessibility, indicating potential pioneer factor ability of NeuroD1. The transcriptional induction of neuronal fate genes is maintained via epigenetic memory despite a transient NeuroD1 induction during neurogenesis. NeuroD1 also induces genes involved in the epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, thereby promoting neuronal migration. Our study not only reveals the NeuroD1‐dependent gene regulatory program driving neurogenesis but also increases our understanding of how cell fate specification during development involves a concerted action of transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Whereas folding of genomes at the large scale of epigenomic compartments and topologically associating domains is now relatively well understood, how chromatin is folded at finer scales remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P), and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation., Hsieh et al. describe chromatin folding at single-nucleosome resolution in mammalian cells using Micro-C, an enhanced chromosome conformation capture method. Micro-C uncovers genome-wide, fine-scale chromatin organizational features shaped by gene activity, transcriptional regulation, and gene silencing.,},

Methods for detection of single-cell epigenomic variation such as DNA methylation sequencing and ATAC-seq hold tremendous promise for delineating distinct cell types and identifying their critical cis-regulatory sequences. Emerging evidence has shown that in addition to cis-regulatory sequences, dynamic regulation of 3D chromatin conformation is a critical mechanism for the modulation of gene expression during development and disease. It remains unclear whether single-cell Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) or Hi-C profiles are suitable for cell type identification and allow the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps. To address these challenges, we have developed a multi-omic method single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (sn-m3C-seq) to profile chromatin conformation and DNA methylation from the same cell. We have shown that bulk m3C-seq and sn-m3C-seq accurately capture chromatin organization information and robustly separate mouse cell types. We have developed a fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting strategy based on DNA content that eliminates nuclei multiplets caused by crosslinking. The sn-m3C-seq method allows high-resolution cell-type classification using two orthogonal types of epigenomic information and the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps.},

We propose here a computational method which combines a kinetic Monte Carlo framework with a deep mutational screening based on deep learning predictions. We apply our method to build regular nucleosome arrays with tailored nucleosomal repeat lengths (NRL) in yeast. Our design was validated in vivo by successfully engineering and integrating thousands of kilobases long tandem arrays of computationally optimized sequences which could accommodate NRLs much larger than the yeast natural NRL (namely 197 and 237 bp, compared to the natural NRL of ∼165 bp). RNA-seq results show that transcription of the arrays can occur but is not driven by the NRL. The computational method proposed here delineates the key sequence rules for nucleosome positioning in yeast and should be easily applicable to other sequence properties and other genomes.,

In many studies, coding or noncoding regions are modified in order to change protein sequences or gene expression levels. Modifying one or several nucleotides in a genome can also lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic regulation of genes. When designing a synthetic genome with many mutations, it would thus be very informative to be able to predict the effect of these mutations on chromatin. We develop here a deep learning approach that quantifies the effect of every possible single mutation on nucleosome positions on the full Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. This type of annotation track can be used when designing a modified S. cerevisiae genome. We further highlight how this track can provide new insights on the sequence-dependent mechanisms that drive nucleosomes’ positions in vivo.},

	abstract = {Nucleosome positioning is involved in many gene regulatory processes happening in the cell, and it may change as cells differentiate or respond to the changing microenvironment in a healthy or diseased organism. One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the “nucleosomics” analysis of cell-free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut {DNA} between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of {DNA} in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here, we report a systematic nucleosomics database — {NucPosDB} — curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. {NucPosDB} also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or {cfDNA} experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning preferences from {DNA} sequence. We provide an overview of the field, describe the structure of the database in this context, and demonstrate data variability using examples of different medical conditions. {NucPosDB} is useful both for the analysis of fundamental gene regulation processes and the training of computational models for patient diagnostics based on {cfDNA}. The database currently curates {\textasciitilde} 400 publications on nucleosome positioning in cell lines and in situ as well as {cfDNA} from {\textgreater} 10,000 patients and healthy volunteers. For open-access {cfDNA} datasets as well as key {MNase}-seq datasets in human cells, {NucPosDB} allows downloading processed mapped data in addition to the regions with stable nucleosome occupancy. {NucPosDB} is available at https://generegulation.org/nucposdb/.},

However, at present our understanding of the rules for DNA sequence-directed nucleosome positioning is fragmentary, and existing positioning sequences have many limitations. We carried out a SELEX experiment starting with a large pool of chemically synthetic random DNA molecules to identify those individuals having the highest affinity for histone octamer. A set of highest-affinity molecules were selected, cloned, and sequenced, their affinities (free energies) for histone octamer in nucleosome reconstitution measured, and their ability to position nucleosomes in vitro assessed by native gel electrophoresis. The selected sequences have higher affinity than previously known natural or non-natural sequences, and have a correspondingly strong nucleosome positioning ability. A variety of analyses including Fourier transform, real-space correlation, and direct counting computations were carried out to assess non-random features in the selected sequences. The results reveal sequence rules that were already identified in earlier studies of natural nucleosomal DNA, together with a large set of new rules having even stronger statistical significance. Possible physical origins of the selected molecules’ high affinities are discussed. The sequences isolated in this study should prove valuable for studies of chromatin structure and function in vitro and, potentially, for studies in vivo.},

This process is an important regulator of all DNA-dependent processes because it determines whether certain DNA sequences are found in regions between nucleosomes with increased accessibility for other factors or wrapped around the histone octamer complex. In a comparison of seven different chromatin-remodeling machines (ACF, ISWI, Snf2H, Chd1, Mi-2, Brg1, and NURF), it is demonstrated that these complexes can read out DNA sequence features to establish specific nucleosome-positioning patterns. For one of the remodelers, ACF, we identified a 40-bp DNA sequence element that directs nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, we show that nucleosome positioning by the remodelers ACF and Chd1 is determined by a reduced affinity to the end product of the translocation reaction. The results suggest that the linkage of differential remodeling activities with the intrinsic binding preferences of nucleosomes can result in establishing distinct chromatin structures that depend on the DNA sequence and define the DNA accessibility for other protein factors.},

We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression.

Drosophila with its polytene chromosomes and developed genetics allows detailed cytological as well as functional analysis of epigenetic histone modifications involved in the control of gene expression pattern during development. All H3K9 mono- and dimethylation together with all H3K27 methylation states and H4K20 trimethylation are predominant marks of pericentric heterochromatin. In euchromatin, bands and interbands are differentially indexed. H3K4 and H3K36 methylation together with H3S10 phosphorylation are predominant marks of interband regions whereas in bands different H3K27 and H4K20 methylation states are combined with acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14. Genetic dissection of heterochromatic gene silencing in position-effect variegation (PEV) by Su(var) and E(var) mutations allowed identification and functional analysis of key factors controlling the formation of heterochromatin. SU(VAR)3-9 association with heterochromatic sequences followed by H3K9 methylation initiates the establishment of repressive SU(VAR)3-9/HP1/SU(VAR)3-7 protein complexes. Differential enzymatic activities of novel point mutants demonstrate that the silencing potential of SU(VAR)3-9 is mainly determined by the kinetic properties of the HMTase reaction. In Su(var)3-9ptn a significantly enhanced enzymatic activity results in H3K9 hypermethylation, enhanced gene silencing and extensive chromatin compaction. Mutations in factors controlling active histone modification marks revealed the dynamic balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Further analysis and definition of Su(var) and E(var) genes in Drosophila will increase our understanding of the molecular hierarchy of processes controlling higher-order structures in chromatin.},

We provide in vivo evidence that lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) is preferentially methylated by the Clr4 protein at heterochromatin-associated regions in fission yeast. Both the conserved chromo- and SET domains of Clr4 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation in vivo. Localization of Swi6, a homolog of Drosophila HP1, to heterochomatic regions is dependent on H3 Lys9 methylation. Moreover, an H3-specific deacetylase Clr3 and a beta-propeller domain protein Rik1 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation by Clr4 and Swi6 localization. These data define a conserved pathway wherein sequential histone modifications establish a "histone code" essential for the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin assembly.},

Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

These transposons have structural similarities to retroviruses. However, the putative product of a 1350 base pair open reading frame detected in the consensus internal sequence of THE1 does not resemble retroviral proteins. The elements are named 'Mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons' (MaLRs). The internal sequence is usually found to be excised. Their presence in rodents, artiodactyls, lagomorphs, and primates, the divergence of the individual elements from their consensus, and the existence of a probably orthologous element in mouse and man suggest that the first MaLRs were distributed before the radiation of eutherian mammals 80-100 million years ago.

Nucleosomes are central in epigenetic pathways and their genomic positioning is associated with regulation of gene expression, DNA replication, DNA methylation and DNA repair, among other functions. Building on prior discoveries that DNA sequences noticeably affect nucleosome positioning, our objective is to identify nucleosome positions and related features across entire genome. Here, we introduce an interpretable framework based on the concepts of deep residual networks (NuPoSe). Trained on high-coverage human experimental MNase-seq data, NuPoSe is able to learn sequence and structural patterns associated with nucleosome organization in human genome. NuPoSe can be also applied to unseen data from different organisms and cell types. Our findings point to 43 informative features, most of them constitute tri-nucleotides, di-nucleotides and one tetra-nucleotide. Most features are significantly associated with the nucleosomal structural characteristics, namely, periodicity of nucleosomal DNA and its location with respect to a histone octamer. Importantly, we show that features derived from the 27 bp linker DNA flanking nucleosomes contribute up to 10\% to the quality of the prediction model. This, along with the comprehensive training sets, deep-learning architecture, and feature selection method, may contribute to the NuPoSe's 80–89\% classification accuracy on different independent datasets.},

Previous studies have manifested that the intrinsic preference of nucleosomes for DNA sequences may play a dominant role in nucleosome positioning. As a consequence, it is nontrivial to develop computational methods only based on DNA sequence information to accurately identify nucleosome positioning, and thus intend to verify the contribution of DNA sequences responsible for nucleosome positioning. In this work, we propose a new deep learning-based method, named DeepNup, which enables us to improve the prediction of nucleosome positioning only from DNA sequences. Specifically, we first use a hybrid feature encoding scheme that combines One-hot encoding and Trinucleotide composition encoding to encode raw DNA sequences; afterwards, we employ multiscale convolutional neural network modules that consist of two parallel convolution kernels with different sizes and gated recurrent units to effectively learn the local and global correlation feature representations; lastly, we use a fully connected layer and a sigmoid unit serving as a classifier to integrate these learned high-order feature representations and generate the final prediction outcomes. By comparing the experimental evaluation metrics on two benchmark nucleosome positioning datasets, DeepNup achieves a better performance for nucleosome positioning prediction than that of several state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate that DeepNup is a powerful deep learning-based tool that enables one to accurately identify potential nucleosome sequences.},

Often consecutively arrayed across the genome, A/T peaks were enriched surrounding transcriptional start sites in specific clades. Most nucleosomes (both in vitro and in vivo) across eukaryotes aligned with A/T peaks, even in the presence of DNA modifications. Using artificial intelligence-based approaches, we describe DNA features associated with nucleosomes and construct a deep learning (DL) model for improved nucleosome occupancy prediction. Using this model, we found that ≈70\% of "random" transfer DNA inserts from an in vivo fungal RB-TDNAseq library avoided DL predicted nucleosome-bound regions.

	abstract = {Here we used a series of CTCF mutations to explore CTCF's relationship with chromatin and its contribution to gene regulation. CTCF's impact depends on the genomic context of bound sites and the unique binding properties of WT and mutant CTCF proteins. Specifically, CTCF's signal strength is linked to changes in accessibility, and the ability to block cohesin is linked to its binding stability. Multivariate modeling reveals that both CTCF and accessibility contribute independently to cohesin binding and insulation, but CTCF signal strength has a stronger effect. CTCF and chromatin have a bidirectional relationship such that at CTCF sites, accessibility is reduced in a cohesin-dependent, mutant-specific fashion. In addition, each mutant alters TF binding and accessibility in an indirect manner, changes which impart the most influence on rewiring transcriptional networks and the cell's ability to differentiate. Collectively, the mutant perturbations provide a rich resource for determining CTCF's site-specific effects.},

	abstract = {CTCF-mediated chromatin folding plays a key role in gene regulation, however the mechanisms controlling chromatin organization across cell states are not fully elucidated. Comprehensive analyses reveal that CTCF binding stability and cohesin overlap in mice and humans, are regulated by species specific differences in CTCF binding site (CBS) accessibility and enrichment of motifs corresponding to expressed TFs. By analyzing TFs, we confirm the co-operativity and competitiveness of TF/CTCF binding, which we further validate by allele specific analysis of SNPs. TF motif enrichment at CTCF bound sites is determined by cell state-specific transcriptional programs, which either stabilize or destabilize CTCF binding, as reflected by changing TF concentration. To examine CTCF binding in the context of nucleosome positioning, we performed single molecule nano-NOMe-seq. Subsetting reveals a continuum of binding states for CTCF, which are differentially represented at accessible versus inaccessible CBSs. As expected, CTCF degradation leads to a progressive loss of binding and nucleosome repositioning giving profiles similar to CTCF free CBSs. We also observe a similar time dependent effect when the cohesin subcomponent, SSC1 is degraded although CTCF remains bound, indicating that cohesin mediates CTCF-associated nucleosome repositioning. Stratified analysis of CTCF signal strength and accessibility reveals that in the presence of cohesin, CTCF strength contributes to nucleosome repositioning and chromatin insulation independent of accessibility. However, cobound TFs can uncouple the relationship between signal strength and nucleosome repositioning, without affecting the connection between repositioning and insulation. These studies identify mechanisms underlying cell state-specific CTCF profiles, linked to local and long-range chromatin organization.},

	abstract = {The rotational positioning of DNA about the histone octamer appears to be determined by certain sequence-dependent modulations of DNA structure. To establish the detailed nature of these interactions, we have analysed the sequences of 177 different DNA molecules from chicken erythrocyte core particles. All variations in the sequence content of these molecules, which may be attributed to sequence-dependent preferences for DNA bending, correlate well with the detailed path of the DNA as it wraps around the histone octamer in the crystal structure of the nucleosome core. The sequence-dependent preferences that correlate most closely with the rotational orientation of the DNA, relative to the surface of the protein, are of two kinds: ApApA/TpTpT and ApApT/ApTpT, the minor grooves of which face predominantly in towards the protein; and also GpGpC/GpCpC and ApGpC/GpCpT, whose minor grooves face outward. Fourier analysis has been used to obtain fractional variations in occurrence for all ten dinucleotide and all 32 trinucleotide arrangements. These sequence preferences should apply generally to many other cases of protein-DNA recognition, where the DNA wraps around a protein. In addition, it is observed that long runs of homopolymer (dA) · (dT) prefer to occupy the ends of core DNA, five to six turns away from the dyad. These same sequences are apparently excluded from the near-centre of core DNA, two to three turns from the dyad. Hence, the translational positioning of any single histone octamer along a DNA molecule of defined sequence may be strongly influenced by the placement of (dA) · (dT) sequences. It may also be influenced by any aversion of the protein for sequences in the “linker” region, the sequence content of which remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Repetitive DNA—sequence motifs repeated hundreds or thousands of times in the genome—makes up the major proportion of all the nuclear DNA in most eukaryotic genomes. However, the significance of repetitive DNA in the genome is not completely understood, and it has been considered to have both structural and functional roles, or perhaps even no essential role. High-throughput DNA sequencing reveals huge numbers of repetitive sequences. Most bioinformatic studies focus on low-copy DNA including genes, and hence, the analyses collapse repeats in assemblies presenting only one or a few copies, often masking out and ignoring them in both DNA and RNA read data. Chromosomal studies are proving vital to examine the distribution and evolution of sequences because of the challenges of analysis of sequence data. Many questions are open about the origin, evolutionary mode and functions that repetitive sequences might have in the genome. Some, the satellite DNAs, are present in long arrays of similar motifs at a small number of sites, while others, particularly the transposable elements (DNA transposons and retrotranposons), are dispersed over regions of the genome; in both cases, sequence motifs may be located at relatively specific chromosome domains such as centromeres or subtelomeric regions. Here, we overview a range of works involving detailed characterization of the nature of all types of repetitive sequences, in particular their organization, abundance, chromosome localization, variation in sequence within and between chromosomes, and, importantly, the investigation of their transcription or expression activity. Comparison of the nature and locations of sequences between more, and less, related species is providing extensive information about their evolution and amplification. Some repetitive sequences are extremely well conserved between species, while others are among the most variable, defining differences between even closely relative species. These data suggest contrasting modes of evolution of repetitive DNA of different types, including selfish sequences that propagate themselves and may even be transferred horizontally between species rather than by descent, through to sequences that have a tendency to amplification because of their sequence motifs, to those that have structural significance because of their bulk rather than precise sequence. Functional consequences of repeats include generation of variability by movement and insertion in the genome (giving useful genetic markers), the definition of centromeres, expression under stress conditions and regulation of gene expression via RNA moieties. Molecular cytogenetics and bioinformatic studies in a comparative context are now enabling understanding of the nature and behaviour of this major genomic component.},

We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, NOMe-seq obtains DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same DNA molecule, giving the first genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.},

However, current Hi-C prediction models are constrained by their narrow applicability to studying the impact of genetic variation on genome folding in specific cell lines, significantly restricting their biological utility. We present Hi-Compass, a generalizable deep learning model that accurately predicts chromatin organization across diverse biological contexts, from bulk to single-cell samples. Hi-Compass outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy and is generalizable to unseen cell types through chromatin accessibility data, enabling broad applications in single cell omics. Hi-Compass successfully resolves cell-type-specific 3D genome architectures in complex biological scenarios, including immune cell states, organ heterogeneity, and tissue spatial organization. Furthermore, Hi-Compass enables integrative analysis of single-cell multiome data, linking chromatin interaction dynamics to gene expression changes across cell clusters, and mapping disease variants to pathogenic genes. Hi-Compass also extends to spatial multi-omics data, generating spatially resolved Hi-C maps that reveal domain-specific chromatin interactions linked to spatial gene expression patterns.},

Their findings suggest a role for H3K9me3 in restraining genomic distribution and activity of {CTCF}, influencing chromatin organization and gene regulation., Six methyltransferases divide labor in establishing genomic profiles of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), an epigenomic modification controlling constitutive heterochromatin, gene repression, and silencing of retroelements. Among them, {SETDB}1 is recruited to active chromatin domains to silence the expression of endogenous retroviruses. In the context of experiments aimed at determining the impact of {SETDB}1 on stimulus-inducible gene expression in macrophages, we found that loss of H3K9me3 caused by {SETDB}1 depletion was associated with increased recruitment of {CTCF} to {\textgreater}1600 {DNA} binding motifs contained within {SINE} B2 repeats, a previously unidentified target of {SETDB}1-mediated repression. {CTCF} is an essential regulator of chromatin folding that restrains {DNA} looping by cohesin, thus creating boundaries among adjacent topological domains. Increased {CTCF} binding to {SINE} B2 repeats enhanced insulation at hundreds of sites and increased loop formation within topological domains containing lipopolysaccharide-inducible genes, which correlated with their impaired regulation in response to stimulation. These data indicate a role of H3K9me3 in restraining genomic distribution and activity of {CTCF}, with an impact on chromatin organization and gene regulation.},

	abstract = {The majority of mammalian genomes are devoted to transposable elements ({TEs}). Whilst {TEs} are increasingly recognized for their important biological functions, they are a potential danger to genomic stability and are carefully regulated by the epigenetic system. However, the full complexity of this regulatory system is not understood. Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that {TEs} are suppressed by heterochromatic marks like H3K9me3, and are also labelled by all major types of chromatin modification in complex patterns, including bivalent activatory and repressive marks. We identified 29 epigenetic modifiers that significantly deregulated at least one type of {TE}. The loss of Setdb1, Ncor2, Rnf2, Kat5, Prmt5, Uhrf1, and Rrp8 caused widespread changes in {TE} expression and chromatin accessibility. These effects were context-specific, with different chromatin modifiers regulating the expression and chromatin accessibility of specific subsets of {TEs}. Our work reveals the complex patterns of epigenetic regulation of {TEs}.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic inheritance concerns the mechanisms that ensure transmission of epigenetic marks from mother to daughter cell. Chromatin modifications and nuclear organization are candidates for epigenetic marks — whether they fulfil the criterion of heritability and what mechanisms ensure their propagation is an area of intensive research.The passage of the replication fork challenges genetic and epigenetic information. Depending on the nature of the epigenetic mark, its inheritance can be ensured in a replication-coupled manner or in a timely manner that is separated from the disruptive event.DNA methylation is inherited at the replication fork in a semi-conservative manner. The redistribution of parental histones, together with their parental modifications at the fork, affects the transmission of information. Histone chaperones have an important role in controlling histone dynamics at the fork. The maintenance of DNA methylation and histone modifications is interconnected at the replication fork.The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CenH3 (CENP-A in humans) is inherited in a replication-uncoupled manner — new CENP-A is deposited in late telophase–G1 phase, highlighting a new window of inheritance during the cell cycle.Restoration of pericentric heterochromatin after passage of the replication fork involves an RNA interference-dependent mechanism in fission yeast, whereas for mammals evidence suggests that the DNA methylation maintenance machinery, chromatin assembly factors and histone modifiers operate in a concerted manner to ensure heterochromatin maintenance.Reprogramming during development highlights the reversibility of epigenetic states.},

Their potential as biomarkers for diagnosing and prognosticating sepsis remains uncertain due, in part, to technical limitations in existing detection methods. This scoping review explores the possible role of nucleosome concentrations in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of sepsis. A comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane and Medline libraries from 1996 to 1 February 2024 identified 110 potentially eligible studies, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing a total of 39 SIRS patients, 893 sepsis patients, 280 septic shock patients, 117 other ICU control patients, and 345 healthy volunteers. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] was the primary method of nucleosome measurement. Studies consistently reported significant correlations between nucleosome levels and other NET biomarkers. Nucleosome levels were higher in patients with sepsis than in healthy volunteers and associated with disease severity, as indicated by SOFA and APACHE II scores. Non-survivors had higher nucleosome levels than survivors. Circulating nucleosome levels, therefore, show promise as early markers of NETosis in sepsis, with moderate diagnostic accuracy and strong correlations with disease severity and prognosis. However, the available evidence is drawn mainly from single-center, observational studies with small sample sizes and varied detection methods, warranting further investigation.},

Methylation, fragmentation, and nucleosome positioning patterns of cfDNA have previously been shown to reveal epigenomic and inferred transcriptomic information. More recently, histone modifications have emerged as a tool to further identify tumor-specific chromatin variants in plasma. A number of sequencing methods have been developed to analyze these epigenetic markers, offering new insights into tumor biology. Features within cfDNA allow for cancer detection, subtype and tissue of origin classification, and inference of gene expression. These methods provide a window into the complexity of cancer and the dynamic nature of its progression. In this review, we highlight the array of epigenetic features in cfDNA that can be extracted from chromatin- and nucleosome-associated organization and outline potential use cases in cancer management.},

Early detection is imperative in colorectal cancer (CRC), as it has been proven to significantly improve patient outcomes. Indeed, in CRC, blood circulating nucleosome levels and their histone alterations have been correlated with tumor stage and the presence of metastasis. Moreover, they constitute promising markers for CRC monitoring and prognosis in a minimally invasive way. The current technologies used for their detection suffer from notable drawbacks such as non-selective identification and quantification of unknown cancer-relevant proteomic trademarks, expensive procedures, and variable results related to staff experience. Taking advantage of the sensitive, fast, cost-effective, and reliable methodologies that electroanalytical technologies offer for the determination of multilevel biomarkers in liquid biopsies, we report in this paper the first electrochemical immunoplatform for the isolation and determination of circulating nucleosomes in plasma using an anti-H3.1 histone variant, integrated with proteomics insights to confirm nucleosomes isolation and identify associated proteins with potential as CRC biomarkers. The developed bioplatform was used to analyze 0.5 μg of nuclear extracts from CRC cells with different metastatic potential as well as 1/5 diluted plasma samples, demonstrating the suitability to effectively discriminate CRC patients in advanced stages from healthy individuals through liquid biopsy.},

	abstract = {Extracellular histones, primarily nuclear proteins involved in chromatin organization, have emerged as key mediators in pathological processes in critically ill patients. When released into circulation due to cell death mechanisms such as NETosis, histones act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), contributing to excessive inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, immune response dysregulation, coagulation activation, cell death, and multi-organ damage. Increasing evidence supports their role in the pathophysiology of sepsis, acute lung injury, cardiac injury, pancreatitis, and other life-threatening conditions. Given their strong association with disease severity and prognosis, circulating histones have gained attention as potential clinical biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring in critically ill patients. This review discusses the biological roles of extracellular histones, their potential as biomarkers, different approaches to measure them, and emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at neutralizing or removing circulating histones to improve patient outcomes in severe medical conditions. Impact statement This review highlights extracellular histones as key mediators and biomarkers in sepsis, proposing their use in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Integrating quantitative proteomics for the detection of circulating histones may enhance patient stratification and guide therapeutic strategies, advancing personalized medicine in critical care.},

	abstract = {Mitotic bookmarking transcription factors ({BFs}) maintain the capacity to bind to their targets during mitosis, despite major rearrangements of the chromatin. While they were thought to propagate gene regulatory information through mitosis by statically occupying their {DNA} targets, it has recently become clear that {BFs} are highly dynamic in mitotic cells. This represents both a technical and a conceptual challenge to study and understand the function of {BFs}: First, formaldehyde has been suggested to be unable to efficiently capture these transient interactions, leading to profound contradictions in the literature; and second, if {BFs} are not permanently bound to their targets during mitosis, it becomes unclear how they convey regulatory information to daughter cells. Here, comparing formaldehyde to alternative fixatives we clarify the nature of the chromosomal association of previously proposed {BFs} in embryonic stem cells: While {ESRRB} can be considered as a canonical {BF} that binds at selected regulatory regions in mitosis, {SOX}2 and {POU}5F1 (also known as {OCT}4) establish {DNA} sequence-independent interactions with the mitotic chromosomes, either throughout the chromosomal arms ({SOX}2) or at pericentromeric regions ({POU}5F1). Moreover, we show that ordered nucleosomal arrays are retained during mitosis at {ESRRB} bookmarked sites, whereas regions losing transcription factor binding display a profound loss of order. By maintaining nucleosome positioning during mitosis, {ESRRB} might ensure the rapid post-mitotic re-establishment of functional regulatory complexes at selected enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that reconciles dynamic mitotic binding with the transmission of gene regulatory information across cell division.},

This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the {DNA} sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input.

Existing methods mainly resolve this issue by retraining the entire model to impose the uncertainty quantification capability so that the learned model can achieve desired performance in accuracy and uncertainty prediction simultaneously. However, training the model from scratch is computationally expensive and may not be feasible in many situations. In this work, we consider a more practical post-hoc uncertainty learning setting, where a well-trained base model is given, and we focus on the uncertainty quantification task at the second stage of training. We propose a novel Bayesian meta-model to augment pre-trained models with better uncertainty quantification abilities, which is effective and computationally efficient. Our proposed method requires no additional training data and is flexible enough to quantify different uncertainties and easily adapt to different application settings, including out-of-domain data detection, misclassification detection, and trustworthy transfer learning. We demonstrate our proposed meta-model approach's flexibility and superior empirical performance on these applications over multiple representative image classification benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Background
{CGGBP}1 is a repeat-binding protein with diverse functions in the regulation of gene expression, cytosine methylation, repeat silencing and genomic integrity. {CGGBP}1 has also been identified as a cooperator of histone-modifying enzymes and as a component of {CTCF}-containing complexes that regulate the enhancer–promoter looping. {CGGBP}1–{CTCF} cross talk in chromatin regulation has been hitherto unknown.

Results
Here, we report that the occupancy of {CTCF} at repeats depends on {CGGBP}1. Using {ChIP}-sequencing for {CTCF}, we describe its occupancy at repetitive {DNA}. Our results show that endogenous level of {CGGBP}1 ensures {CTCF} occupancy preferentially on repeats over canonical {CTCF} motifs. By combining {CTCF} {ChIP}-sequencing results with {ChIP} sequencing for three different kinds of histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), we show that the {CGGBP}1-dependent repeat-rich {CTCF}-binding sites regulate histone marks in flanking regions.

Conclusion
{CGGBP}1 affects the pattern of {CTCF} occupancy. Our results posit {CGGBP}1 as a regulator of {CTCF} and its binding sites in interspersed repeats.},

	abstract = {More than one million copies of short interspersed elements ({SINEs}), a class of retrotransposons, are present in the mammalian genomes, particularly within gene-rich genomic regions. Evidence has accumulated that ancient {SINE} sequences have acquired new binding sites for transcription factors ({TFs}) through multiple mutations following retrotransposition, and as a result have rewired the host regulatory network during the course of evolution. However, it remains unclear whether currently active {SINEs} contribute to the expansion of {TF} binding sites. To study the mobility, expression, and function of {SINE} copies, we ﬁrst identiﬁed about 2,000 insertional polymorphisms of {SINE} B1 and B2 families within Mus musculus. Using a novel {RNA} sequencing method designated as {melRNA}-seq, we detected the expression of {SINEs} in male germ cells at both the subfamily and genomic copy levels: the vast majority of B1 {RNAs} originated from evolutionarily young subfamilies, whereas B2 {RNAs} originated from both young and old subfamilies. {DNA} methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) analyses in liver revealed that polymorphic B2 insertions served as a boundary element inhibiting the expansion of {DNA} hypomethylated and histone hyperacetylated regions, and decreased the expression of neighboring genes. Moreover, genomic B2 copies were enriched at the boundary of various histone modiﬁcations, and chromatin insulator protein, {CCCTC}-binding factor, a well-known chromatin boundary protein, bound to {\textgreater}100 polymorphic and {\textgreater}10,000 non-polymorphic B2 insertions. These results suggest that the currently active B2 copies are mobile boundary elements that can modulate chromatin modiﬁcations and gene expression, and are likely involved in epigenomic and phenotypic diversiﬁcation of the mouse species.},

	abstract = {{JASPAR} (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) is an open-access database containing manually curated, non-redundant transcription factor ({TF}) binding profiles for {TFs} across six taxonomic groups. In this 9th release, we expanded the {CORE} collection with 341 new profiles (148 for plants, 101 for vertebrates, 85 for urochordates, and 7 for insects), which corresponds to a 19\% expansion over the previous release. We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of {DNA} binding domains to consider plant-specific {TFs}. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each {TF}. We updated the genome tracks of {TFBSs} predicted with {JASPAR} profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse {TFBS} predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the {UCSC} Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform {JASPAR} {TFBS} enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions. All the data is accessible through the {JASPAR} website, its associated {RESTful} {API}, the R/Bioconductor data package, and a new Python package, {pyJASPAR}, that facilitates serverless access to the data.},

The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes limit access to DNA, which antagonizes gene expression and prevents recruitment of transcription factors that cannot bind DNA wrapped around the histone octamer. Numerous studies using large cell populations determined that active genes promoters tend to be nucleosome-depleted. We developed a method to examine nucleosome positioning in single cells and revealed significant heterogeneity of nucleosome configurations within a population. In an inactive gene loaded with nucleosomes, a small subpopulation of nucleosome-depleted cells exists that were engaged in transcription. Single-cell mapping revealed that even in apparently nucleosome-free regions, some cells were occupied by nucleosomes. These data reveal an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning and its role in regulating gene expression., Nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin, have a critical role in the control of gene expression. Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect DNA from GpC methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible PHO5 gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the PHO5 promoter that introduce a poly(dA:dT) tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of PHO5. By contrast, mutations that altered AA/TT/AT periodicity reduced gene expression upon PHO5 induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for DNA antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as “fuzzy” or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

Nucleosomes are not randomly located on the DNA but positioned with respect to the DNA sequence, suggesting models in which critical binding sites are either exposed in the linker, resulting in activation, or buried inside a nucleosome, resulting in repression. The mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning are therefore of paramount importance for understanding gene regulation and other events that occur in chromatin, such as transcription, replication, and repair. Here, we review our current understanding of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning: DNA sequence, nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and transcription. We outline the major challenges for the future: elucidating the precise mechanisms of chromatin opening and promoter activation, identifying the complexes that occupy promoters, and understanding the multiscale problem of chromatin fiber organization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Chromatin structure formation leads to 10-11 base pair (bp) discretization of linker lengths caused by the smaller free energy cost of packaging nucleosomes into regular chromatin fibers if their rotational setting (defined by the DNA helical twist) is conserved. We describe nucleosome positions along the fiber using a thermodynamic model of finite-size particles with both intrinsic histone-DNA interactions and an effective two-body potential. We infer one- and two-body energies directly from high-throughput maps of nucleosome positions. We show that higher-order chromatin structure helps explains in vitro and in vivo nucleosome ordering in transcribed regions, and plays a leading role in establishing well-known 10-11 bp genome-wide periodicity of nucleosome positions.},

	abstract = {The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density. While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et al. argued that the pattern observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is qualitatively consistent with a “barrier nucleosome model,” in which the oscillatory pattern is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs. Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by the same physical model with the same parameters, but different boundary conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ∼1,000 bp to each side.},

We have developed a biophysical model, DNABEND, for the sequence dependence of DNA bending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free energies of nucleosome formation and a set of in vitro nucleosome positions mapped at high resolution. We have also made a first ab initio prediction of nucleosomal DNA geometries, and checked its accuracy against the nucleosome crystal structure. We have used DNABEND to design both strong and weak histone- binding sequences, and measured the corresponding free energies of nucleosome formation. We find that DNABEND can successfully predict in vitro nucleosome positions and free energies, providing a physical explanation for the intrinsic sequence dependence of histone–DNA interactions.},

We examine the effects of H3K9-methylation-dependent gene repression in haematopoiesis, muscle differentiation and neurogenesis in mammals, and compare them with mechanistic insights obtained from the study of model organisms, notably Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In all these organisms, H3K9-specific {HMTs} have both unique and redundant roles that ensure the maintenance of tissue integrity by restricting the binding of transcription factors to lineage-specific promoters and enhancer elements.},

The organization of these nucleosomes on genomic DNA is influenced by the DNA sequence. Here, we present a structure-based computational approach that translates sequence information into the energy required to bend DNA into a nucleosome-bound conformation. The calculations establish the relationship between DNA sequence and histone octamer binding affinity. In silico selection using this model identified several new DNA sequences, which were experimentally found to have histone octamer affinities comparable to the highest-affinity sequences known. The results provide insights into the molecular mechanism through which DNA sequence information encodes its organization. A quantitative appreciation of the thermodynamics of nucleosome positioning and rearrangement will be one of the key factors in understanding the regulation of transcription and in the design of new promoter architectures for the purposes of tuning gene expression dynamics.},

Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular DNA sequences, reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to DNA. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome-DNA interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain approximately 50\% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation, and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves.},

The majority of the nucleosomes identified were well-positioned. We found a stereotyped chromatin organization at Pol II promoters consisting of a nucleosome-free region approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start codon flanked on both sides by positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free sequences were evolutionarily conserved and were enriched in poly-deoxyadenosine or poly-deoxythymidine sequences. Most occupied transcription factor binding motifs were devoid of nucleosomes, strongly suggesting that nucleosome positioning is a global determinant of transcription factor access.},

Therefore, {TEs} and {KRAB}-{ZFPs} establish transcriptional networks that regulate not only development but probably many physiological events.

	abstract = {Gene regulation in eukaryotes emerges from a dynamic interplay between transcription factors (TFs), nucleosomes, and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), whose competitive and cooperative binding shapes DNA accessibility and transcriptional output. Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) and long-read chromatin accessibility assays such as Fiber-seq now capture these interactions at nucleotide resolution on individual DNA molecules. However, existing computational tools remain insufficient to decode complex binding events from sparse methylation data. Here, we introduce HiddenFoot, a probabilistic modeling framework based on statistical mechanics that quantitatively infers TF, nucleosome, and Pol II occupancy profiles on single DNA molecules by systematically evaluating all thermodynamically plausible binding configurations. Applying HiddenFoot to SMF and Fiber-seq data from mouse, Drosophila, and human cells, we recovered known TF footprints, precisely resolved Pol II pausing, and identified extensive heterogeneity in nucleosome positioning driven by TF binding. HiddenFoot further distinguishes direct TF–TF cooperativity from nucleosome-mediated co-dependency by estimating pairwise interaction energies and comparing to null models under equilibrium. By integrating biophysical modeling with high-resolution single-molecule data, HiddenFoot offers a general, interpretable framework for dissecting regulatory logic in native chromatin with base-pair precision.

Here, using only sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and intrinsic curvature, we predict the nucleosome occupancy along the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate the predictive power and universality of our model through its correlation with experimentally determined nucleosome occupancy data. In yeast promoter regions, the computed average nucleosome occupancy closely superimposes with experimental data, exhibiting a {\textless}200 bp region unfavourable for nucleosome formation bordered by regions that facilitate nucleosome formation. In the fly, our model faithfully predicts promoter strength as encoded in distinct chromatin architectures characteristic of strongly and weakly expressed genes. We also predict that nucleosomes are repositioned by active mechanisms at the majority of fly promoters. Our model uses only basic physical properties to describe the wrapping of DNA around the histone core, yet it captures a substantial part of chromatin's structural complexity, thus leading to a much better prediction of nucleosome occupancy than methods based merely on periodic curved DNA motifs. Our results indicate that the physical properties of the DNA chain, and not just the regulatory factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, play key roles in eukaryotic transcription.},

In the emerging model, known as “statistical positioning”, this spacing is due to steric repulsion between nucleosomes and to the presence of nucleosome excluding barriers on the genome. However, new experimental evidence recently challenged the “statistical positioning” model (Z. Zhang et al., Science, 2011, 332(6032), 977–980). We propose here that the regular spacing can be better explained by adding attractive interactions between nucleosomes. In our model those attractions are due to the fact that nucleosomes are stacked in regular chromatin fibers. In a self-reinforcing mechanism, regular nucleosome spacing promotes in turn nucleosome stacking. We first show that this model can precisely account for the nucleosome spacing observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then use a simple toy model to show that attraction between nucleosomes can fasten the formation of the chromatin fiber.},

ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple 2-step protocol from 500 to 50,000 cells, and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA binding proteins, individual nucleosomes, and higher-order compaction at regulatory regions with nucleotide resolution. We discover classes of DNA binding factor that strictly avoid, can tolerate, or tend to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq, we measured and interpreted the serial daily epigenomes of resting human T cells from a proband via standard blood draws, demonstrating the feasibility of reading personal epigenomes in clinical timescales for monitoring health and disease.},

However, it is unclear how frequent co-option of transposable elements as regulatory elements is, to which regulatory programs they contribute and how they compare to regulatory elements devoid of transposable elements. Here, we report a transcription initiation-centric, in-depth characterization of the transposon-derived regulatory landscape of mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that a substantial number of transposable element insertions, in particular endogenous retroviral elements, are associated with open chromatin regions that are divergently transcribed into unstable {RNAs} in a cell-type specific manner, and that these elements contribute to a sizable proportion of active enhancers and gene promoters. We further show that transposon subfamilies contribute differently and distinctly to the pluripotency regulatory program through their repertoires of transcription factor binding site sequences, shedding light on the formation of regulatory programs and the origins of regulatory elements.},

	abstract = {The role of the zinc finger protein {CTCF} in organizing the genome within the nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on {DNA}, occupied by both {CTCF} and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also mediated by {CTCF}, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these {CTCF} interactions have specific rules for the orientation of the paired {CTCF} sites, implying the existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating {CTCF} pair result in major changes in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis. As recently published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with noncoding {RNAs} as well as protein cofactors. Many {CTCF} sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of {RNA} splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time.},

	abstract = {The {CCCTC}-binding factor ({CTCF}) binds tens of thousands of enhancers and promoters on mammalian chromosomes by means of its 11 tandem zinc finger ({ZF}) {DNA}-binding domain. In addition to the 12–15-bp {CORE} sequence, some of the {CTCF} binding sites contain 5′ upstream and/or 3′ downstream motifs. Here, we describe two structures for overlapping portions of human {CTCF}, respectively, including {ZF}1–{ZF}7 and {ZF}3–{ZF}11 in complex with {DNA} that incorporates the {CORE} sequence together with either 3′ downstream or 5′ upstream motifs. Like conventional tandem {ZF} array proteins, {ZF}1–{ZF}7 follow the right-handed twist of the {DNA}, with each finger occupying and recognizing one triplet of three base pairs in the {DNA} major groove. {ZF}8 plays a unique role, acting as a spacer across the {DNA} minor groove and positioning {ZF}9–{ZF}11 to make cross-strand contacts with {DNA}. We ascribe the difference between the two subgroups of {ZF}1–{ZF}7 and {ZF}8–{ZF}11 to residues at the two positions −6 and −5 within each finger, with small residues for {ZF}1–{ZF}7 and bulkier and polar/charged residues for {ZF}8–{ZF}11. {ZF}8 is also uniquely rich in basic amino acids, which allows salt bridges to {DNA} phosphates in the minor groove. Highly specific arginine–guanine and glutamine–adenine interactions, used to recognize G:C or A:T base pairs at conventional base-interacting positions of {ZFs}, also apply to the cross-strand interactions adopted by {ZF}9–{ZF}11. The differences between {ZF}1–{ZF}7 and {ZF}8–{ZF}11 can be rationalized structurally and may contribute to recognition of high-affinity {CTCF} binding sites.},

	abstract = {Proteins with sequence-specific {DNA} binding function are important for a wide range of biological activities. De novo prediction of their {DNA}-binding specificities from sequence alone would be a great aid in inferring cellular networks. Here we introduce a method for predicting {DNA}-binding specificities for Cys2His2 zinc fingers (C2H2-{ZFs}), the largest family of {DNA}-binding proteins in metazoans. We develop a general approach, based on empirical calculations of pairwise amino acid-nucleotide interaction energies, for predicting position weight matrices ({PWMs}) representing {DNA}-binding specificities for C2H2-{ZF} proteins. We predict {DNA}-binding specificities on a per-finger basis and merge predictions for C2H2-{ZF} domains that are arrayed within sequences. We test our approach on a diverse set of natural C2H2-{ZF} proteins with known binding specificities and demonstrate that for {\textgreater}85\% of the proteins, their predicted {PWMs} are accurate in 50\% of their nucleotide positions. For proteins with several zinc finger isoforms, we show via case studies that this level of accuracy enables us to match isoforms with their known {DNA}-binding specificities. A web server for predicting a {PWM} given a protein containing C2H2-{ZF} domains is available online at http://zf.princeton.edu and can be used to aid in protein engineering applications and in genome-wide searches for transcription factor targets.},

	abstract = {Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) are eukaryotic non-autonomous retrotransposons transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). The 3′-terminus of many mammalian SINEs has a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA), pol III transcription terminator, and A-rich tail. The RNAs of such SINEs can be polyadenylated, which is unique for pol III transcripts. Here, B2 (mice and related rodents), Dip (jerboas), and Ves (vespertilionid bats) SINE families were thoroughly studied. They were divided into subfamilies reliably distinguished by relatively long indels. The age of SINE subfamilies can be estimated, which allows us to reconstruct their evolution. The youngest and most active variants of SINE subfamilies were given special attention. The shortest pol III transcription terminators are TCTTT (B2), TATTT (Ves and Dip), and the rarer TTTT. The last nucleotide of the terminator is often not transcribed; accordingly, the truncated terminator of its descendant becomes nonfunctional. The incidence of complete transcription of the TCTTT terminator is twice higher compared to TTTT and thus functional terminators are more likely preserved in daughter SINE copies. Young copies have long poly(A) tails; however, they gradually shorten in host generations. Unexpectedly, the tail shortening below A10 increases the incidence of terminator elongation by Ts thus restoring its efficiency. This process can be critical for the maintenance of SINE activity in the genome.},

Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms.

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

Our data indicate that activation of retroelements has produced species-speciﬁc expansions of {CTCF} binding in rodents, dogs, and opossum, which often functionally serve as chromatin and transcriptional insulators. We discovered fossilized repeat elements ﬂanking deeply conserved {CTCF}-binding regions, indicating that similar retrotransposon expansions occurred hundreds of millions of years ago.

Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in nucleosome occupancy and positioning in pronucleus-stage zygotes using ultra low-input MNase-seq. We observed distinct features of inheritance and reconstruction of nucleosome positioning in both paternal and maternal genomes. Genome-wide de novo nucleosome occupancy in the paternal genome was observed as early as 1 h after the injection of sperm into ooplasm. The nucleosome positioning pattern was continually rebuilt to form nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) at promoters and transcription factor (TF) binding sites with differential dynamics in paternal and maternal genomes. NDRs formed more quickly on the promoters of genes involved in zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and this formation is closely linked to histone acetylation, but not transcription elongation or DNA replication. Importantly, we found that NDR establishment on the binding motifs of specific TFs might be associated with their potential pioneer functions in ZGA. Further investigations suggested that the predicted factors MLX and RFX1 played important roles in regulating minor and major ZGA, respectively. Our data not only elucidate the nucleosome positioning dynamics in both male and female pronuclei following fertilization, but also provide an efficient method for identifying key transcription regulators during development.},

The topologically associating domains ({TADs}) demarcated by {CTCF} are remarkably well conserved between species, although genome-wide {CTCF} binding has diverged substantially following transposon-mediated motif expansions. Therefore, the {CTCF} consensus motif poorly predicts {TADs}, and additional factors must modulate {CTCF} binding and subsequent {TAD} formation. Here, we demonstrate that the {ChAHP} complex ({CHD}4, {ADNP}, {HP}1) competes with {CTCF} for a common set of binding motifs. In Adnp knockout cells, novel insulated regions are formed at sites normally bound by {ChAHP}, whereas proximal canonical boundaries are weakened. These data reveal that {CTCF}-mediated loop formation is modulated by a distinct zinc-finger protein complex. Strikingly, {ChAHP}-bound loci are mainly situated within less diverged {SINE} B2 transposable elements. This implicates {ChAHP} in maintenance of evolutionarily conserved spatial chromatin organization by buffering novel {CTCF} binding sites that emerged through {SINE} expansions.},

Here we investigate chromatin boundaries in mouse embryonic stem cells, defined by the regions with decreased Nucleosome Repeat Length ({NRL}) for ∼20 nucleosomes near {CTCF} sites, affecting up to 10\% of the genome. We found that the nucleosome-depleted region ({NDR}) near {CTCF} is asymmetrically located {\textgreater}40 nucleotides 5'-upstream from the centre of {CTCF} motif. The strength of {CTCF} binding to {DNA} and the presence of cohesin is correlated with the decrease of {NRL} near {CTCF}, and anti-correlated with the level of asymmetry of the nucleosome array. Individual chromatin remodellers have different contributions, with Snf2h having the strongest effect on the {NRL} decrease near {CTCF} and Chd4 playing a major role in the symmetry breaking. Upon differentiation, a subset of preserved, common {CTCF} sites maintains asymmetric nucleosome pattern and small {NRL}. The sites which lost {CTCF} upon differentiation are characterized by nucleosome rearrangement 3'-downstream, with unchanged {NDR} 5'-upstream of {CTCF} motifs. Boundaries of topologically associated chromatin domains frequently contain several inward-oriented {CTCF} motifs whose effects, described above, add up synergistically.},

	abstract = {De novo mutations in {ADNP}, which encodes activity-dependent neuroprotective protein ({ADNP}), have recently been found to underlie Helsmoortel–Van der Aa syndrome, a complex neurological developmental disorder that also affects several other organ functions1. {ADNP} is a putative transcription factor that is essential for embryonic development2. However, its precise roles in transcriptional regulation and development are not understood. Here we show that {ADNP} interacts with the chromatin remodeller {CHD}4 and the chromatin architectural protein {HP}1 to form a stable complex, which we refer to as {ChAHP}. Besides mediating complex assembly, {ADNP} recognizes {DNA} motifs that specify binding of {ChAHP} to euchromatin. Genetic ablation of {ChAHP} components in mouse embryonic stem cells results in spontaneous differentiation concomitant with premature activation of lineage-specific genes and in a failure to differentiate towards the neuronal lineage. Molecularly, {ChAHP}-mediated repression is fundamentally different from canonical {HP}1-mediated silencing: {HP}1 proteins, in conjunction with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), are thought to assemble broad heterochromatin domains that are refractory to transcription. {ChAHP}-mediated repression, however, acts in a locally restricted manner by establishing inaccessible chromatin around its {DNA}-binding sites and does not depend on H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes. Together, our results reveal that {ADNP}, via the recruitment of {HP}1 and {CHD}4, regulates the expression of genes that are crucial for maintaining distinct cellular states and assures accurate cell fate decisions upon external cues. Such a general role of {ChAHP} in governing cell fate plasticity may explain why {ADNP} mutations affect several organs and body functions and contribute to cancer progression1,3,4. Notably, we found that the integrity of the {ChAHP} complex is disrupted by nonsense mutations identified in patients with Helsmoortel–Van der Aa syndrome, and this could be rescued by aminoglycosides that suppress translation termination5. Therefore, patients might benefit from therapeutic agents that are being developed to promote ribosomal read-through of premature stop codons6,7.},

In serum, female {ESCs} are hypomethyated similarly to male {ESCs} in 2i, and {DNA} methylation is further reduced in 2i. Regions with elevated {DNA} methylation in 2i strongly correlate with the presence of H3K9me3 on endogenous retroviruses ({ERVs}) and imprinted loci.

This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.},

Because {REs} are much more dynamic than single-copy {DNA}, repetitive sequences can reveal signals of evolutionary history over short time scales that may not be evident in sequences from slower-evolving genomic regions. Many tools for studying {REs} are directed toward organisms with existing genomic resources, including genome assemblies and repeat libraries. However, signals in repeat variation may prove especially valuable in disentangling evolutionary histories in diverse non-model groups, for which genomic resources are limited. Here we introduce {RepeatProfiler}, a tool for generating, visualizing, and comparing repetitive element {DNA} profiles from low-coverage, short-read sequence data. {RepeatProfiler} automates the generation and visualization of {RE} coverage depth profiles ({RE} profiles) and allows for statistical comparison of profile shape across samples. In addition, {RepeatProfiler} facilitates comparison of profiles by extracting signal from sequence variants across profiles which can then be analyzed as molecular morphological characters using phylogenetic analysis. We validate {RepeatProfiler} with data sets from ground beetles (Bembidion), flies (Drosophila), and tomatoes (Solanum). We highlight the potential of {RE} profiles as a high-resolution data source for studies in species delimitation, comparative genomics, and repeat biology.},

We investigate the relationship between DNA sequence and the spontaneous loading and activity of chromatin components in the absence of coevolution. Using bacterial genomes integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which diverged from yeast more than 2 billion years ago, we show that nucleosomes, cohesins, and associated transcriptional machinery can lead to the formation of two different chromatin archetypes, one transcribed and the other silent, independently of heterochromatin formation. These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.},

	abstract = {Leukemia is a complex hematologic cancer driven by genetic and epigenetic changes that impact gene expression. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is essential for improving leukemia diagnosis and prognosis. This study examines the role of the zinc finger protein ZNF384 in the epigenome and its influence on gene regulation in leukemia. We analyzed next-generation sequencing data from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), integrating datasets such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of ZNF384 and regulatory histone marks, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Hi-C data from K562 and GM12878 cells. Additionally, we used RNA-seq from K562 ZNF384 knock-down (KD) cells generated via CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to validate our findings. This enabled us to explore the chromatin interaction patterns of ZNF384 and its regulatory impact. Our results demonstrate that ZNF384 associates with promoters and enhancers in K562 and GM12878 cells, facilitating increased transcription levels. We also found ZNF384 enriched at topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries and chromatin loops, suggesting a role in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization. Furthermore, we identified a significant binding of ZNF384 at SINE-Alu elements in both K562 and GM12878 cells. In summary, this study highlights the regulatory role of ZNF384 in the leukemia epigenome and its impact on gene expression. Understanding the oncogenic implications of ZNF384 may improve leukemia diagnosis and prognosis.},

The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther distances from the barrier.

Our {DNA}-{GCN} is initialized with a one-hot representation for all nodes, and it then jointly learns the embeddings for both k-mers and sequences, as supervised by the known labels of sequences. We evaluate our model on 50 datasets from {ENCODE}. {DNA}-{GCN} shows its competitive performance compared with the baseline model.

We utilized a high-throughput binding assay to record more than 270,000 different {DNA}/protein binding measurements along incrementally tiled windows of {DNA} within these {PluCRs}. This high-resolution binding map is then used to systematically define the context of {POU} factor binding, and reveals patterns of cooperativity and competition in the pluripotency network. The most prominent pattern is a pervasive binding competition between {POU}5F1 and the forkhead transcription factors. Like many transcription factors, {POU}5F1 is co-expressed with a paralog, {POU}2F1, that shares an apparently identical binding specificity. By analyzing thousands of binding measurements, we discover context effects that discriminate {POU}2F1 from {POU}5F1 binding. Proximal {NANOG} binding promotes {POU}5F1 binding, whereas nearby {SOX}2 binding favors {POU}2F1. We demonstrate by cross-species comparison and by chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) that the contextual sequence determinants learned in vitro are sufficient to predict {POU}2F1 binding in vivo.},

	abstract = {Most eukaryotic transcription factors ({TFs}) are part of large protein families, with members of the same family (i.e., paralogous {TFs}) recognizing similar {DNA}-binding motifs but performing different regulatory functions. Many {TF} paralogs are coexpressed in the cell and thus can compete for target sites across the genome. However, this competition is rarely taken into account when studying the in vivo binding patterns of eukaryotic {TFs}. Here, we show that direct competition for {DNA} binding between {TF} paralogs is a major determinant of their genomic binding patterns. Using yeast proteins Cbf1 and Pho4 as our model system, we designed a high-throughput quantitative assay to capture the genomic binding profiles of competing {TFs} in a cell-free system. Our data show that Cbf1 and Pho4 greatly influence each other's occupancy by competing for their common putative genomic binding sites. The competition is different at different genomic sites, as dictated by the {TFs}' expression levels and their divergence in {DNA}-binding specificity and affinity. Analyses of {ChIP}-seq data show that the biophysical rules that dictate the competitive {TF} binding patterns in vitro are also followed in vivo, in the complex cellular environment. Furthermore, the Cbf1-Pho4 competition for genomic sites, as characterized in vitro using our new assay, plays a critical role in the specific activation of their target genes in the cell. Overall, our study highlights the importance of direct {TF}-{TF} competition for genomic binding and gene regulation by {TF} paralogs, and proposes an approach for studying this competition in a quantitative and high-throughput manner.},

While recruitment of specific genomic regions into these large ribonucleoprotein ({RNP}) complexes critically contributes to higher-order functional chromatin organization, such regions remain ill-defined. We have developed the high-salt–recovered sequences-sequencing ({HRS}-seq) method, a straightforward genome-wide approach whereby we isolated and sequenced genomic regions associated with large high-salt insoluble {RNP} complexes. By using mouse embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}), we showed that these regions essentially correspond to the most highly expressed genes, and to cis-regulatory sequences like super-enhancers, that belong to the active A chromosomal compartment. They include both cell-type–specific genes, such as pluripotency genes in {ESCs}, and housekeeping genes associated with nuclear bodies, such as histone and {snRNA} genes that are central components of Histone Locus Bodies and Cajal bodies. We conclude that {HRSs} are associated with the active chromosomal compartment and with large {RNP} complexes including nuclear bodies. Association of such chromosomal regions with nuclear bodies is in agreement with the recently proposed phase separation model for transcription control and might thus play a central role in organizing the active chromosomal compartment in mammals.},

Though the role of {DNA} sequence in positioning nucleosomes is well understood, a detailed mechanistic understanding on the impact of transcription remains lacking. Using numerical simulations, we investigated the dependence of nucleosome density profiles on transcription level across multiple species. We found that the low nucleosome affinity of yeast, but not mouse, promoters contributes to the formation of phased nucleosomes arrays for inactive genes. For the active genes, a heterogeneous distribution of +1 nucleosomes, caused by a tug-of-war between two types of remodeling enzymes, is essential for reproducing their density profiles. In particular, while positioning enzymes are known to remodel the +1 nucleosome and align it toward the transcription start site ({TSS}), spacer enzymes that use a pair of nucleosomes as their substrate can shift the nucleosome array away from the {TSS}. Competition between these enzymes results in two types of nucleosome density profiles with well- and ill-positioned +1 nucleosome. Finally, we showed that Pol {II} assisted histone exchange, if occurring at a fast speed, can abolish the impact of remodeling enzymes. By elucidating the role of individual factors, our study reconciles the seemingly conflicting results on the overall impact of transcription in positioning nucleosomes across species.},

More formally, the uniqueness or (k, e)-mappability can be described for every position as the reciprocal value of how often this k-mer occurs approximately in the genome, i.e. with up to e mismatches.We present a fast method {GenMap} to compute the (k, e)-mappability. We extend the mappability algorithm, such that it can also be computed across multiple genomes where a k-mer occurrence is only counted once per genome. This allows for the computation of marker sequences or finding candidates for probe design by identifying approximate k-mers that are unique to a genome or that are present in all genomes. {GenMap} supports different formats such as binary output, wig and bed files as well as csv files to export the location of all approximate k-mers for each genomic position.{GenMap} can be installed via bioconda.

Functional regions of {DNA}, {RNA}, and protein sequences often exhibit characteristic but subtle motifs; thus, computational discovery of motifs in sequences is a fundamental and much-studied problem. However, most current algorithms do not allow for insertions or deletions (indels) within motifs, and the few that do have other limitations. We present a method, {GLAM}2 (Gapped Local Alignment of Motifs), for discovering motifs allowing indels in a fully general manner, and a companion method {GLAM}2SCAN for searching sequence databases using such motifs. glam2 is a generalization of the gapless Gibbs sampling algorithm. It re-discovers variable-width protein motifs from the {PROSITE} database significantly more accurately than the alternative methods {PRATT} and {SAM}-T2K. Furthermore, it usefully refines protein motifs from the {ELM} database: in some cases, the refined motifs make orders of magnitude fewer overpredictions than the original {ELM} regular expressions. {GLAM}2 performs respectably on the {BAliBASE} multiple alignment benchmark, and may be superior to leading multiple alignment methods for “motif-like” alignments with N- and C-terminal extensions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of {GLAM}2 to discover protein kinase substrate motifs and a gapped {DNA} motif for the {LIM}-only transcriptional regulatory complex: using {GLAM}2SCAN, we identify promising targets for the latter. {GLAM}2 is especially promising for short protein motifs, and it should improve our ability to identify the protein cleavage sites, interaction sites, post-translational modification attachment sites, etc., that underlie much of biology. It may be equally useful for arbitrarily gapped motifs in {DNA} and {RNA}, although fewer examples of such motifs are known at present. {GLAM}2 is public domain software, available for download at http://bioinformatics.org.au/glam2.},

Thus, defining a novel epigenetic feature of {NSPCs} is crucial for developing stem cell therapy to address neurologic disorders caused by injury. In this study, we aimed to define the R-loop, a three-stranded nucleic acid structure, as an epigenetic characteristic of {NSPCs} during neurodevelopment. Our results demonstrated that R-loop levels change dynamically throughout neurodevelopment. Cells with high levels of R-loops consistently decreased and were enriched in the area of neurogenesis. Additionally, these cells costained with {SOX}2 during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, these cells with high R-loop levels expressed Ki-67 and exhibited a high degree of overlap with the transcriptional activation markers, H3K4me3, ser5, and H3K27ac. These findings suggest that R-loops may serve as an epigenetic feature for transcriptional activation in {NSPCs}, indicating their role in gene expression regulation and neurogenesis.},

Approximately half of the mammalian genome consists of repetitive elements, including retrotransposons, some of which are transcribed after fertilization. Retrotransposon activation is generally assumed to be a side effect of the extensive chromatin remodeling underlying the epigenetic reprogramming of gametes. Here, we used a targeted epigenomic approach to address whether specific retrotransposon families play a direct role in chromatin organization and developmental progression. We demonstrate that premature silencing of LINE-1 elements decreases chromatin accessibility, whereas prolonged activation prevents the gradual chromatin compaction that occurs naturally in developmental progression. Preventing LINE-1 activation and interfering with its silencing decreases developmental rates independently of the coding nature of the LINE-1 transcript, thus suggesting that LINE-1 functions primarily at the chromatin level. Our data suggest that activation of LINE-1 regulates global chromatin accessibility at the beginning of development and indicate that retrotransposon activation is integral to the developmental program.},

We de novo sequenced the genomes of the African (Protopterus annectens) and South American lungfishes (Lepidosiren paradoxa). The Lepidosiren genome (about 91 Gb, roughly 30 times the human genome) is the largest animal genome sequenced so far and more than twice the size of the Australian (Neoceratodus forsteri)1 and African2 lungfishes owing to enlarged intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (about 90\%). All lungfish genomes continue to expand as some transposable elements (TEs) are still active today. In particular, Lepidosiren’s genome grew extremely fast during the past 100 million years (Myr), adding the equivalent of one human genome every 10 Myr. This massive genome expansion seems to be related to a reduction of PIWI-interacting RNAs and C2H2 zinc-finger and Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-domain protein genes that suppress TE expansions. Although TE abundance facilitates chromosomal rearrangements, lungfish chromosomes still conservatively reflect the ur-tetrapod karyotype. Neoceratodus’ limb-like fins still resemble those of their extinct relatives and remained phenotypically static for about 100 Myr. We show that the secondary loss of limb-like appendages in the Lepidosiren–Protopterus ancestor was probably due to loss of sonic hedgehog limb-specific enhancers.},

	abstract = {Background
L1Md retrotransposons are the most abundant and active transposable elements in the mouse genome. The promoters of many L1Md retrotransposons are composed of tandem repeats called monomers. The number of monomers varies between retrotransposon copies, thus making it difficult to annotate L1Md promoters. Duplication of monomers contributes to the maintenance of L1Md promoters during truncation-prone retrotranspositions, but the associated mechanism remains unclear. Since the current classification of monomers is based on limited data, a comprehensive monomer annotation is needed for supporting functional studies of L1Md promoters genome-wide.

Results
We developed a pipeline for de novo monomer detection and classification. Identified monomers are further classified into subtypes based on their sequence profiles. We applied this pipeline to genome assemblies of various rodent species. A major monomer subtype of the lab mouse was also found in other Mus species, implying that such subtype has emerged in the common ancestor of involved species. We also characterized the positioning pattern of monomer subtypes within individual promoters. Our analyses indicate that the subtype composition of an L1Md promoter can be used to infer its transcriptional activity during male germ cell development.

Conclusions
We identified subtypes for all monomer types using comprehensive data, greatly expanding the spectrum of monomer variants. The analysis of monomer subtype positioning provides evidence supporting both previously proposed models of L1Md promoter expansion. The transcription silencing of L1Md promoters differs between promoter types, which supports a model involving distinct suppressive pathways rather than a universal mechanism for retrotransposon repression in gametogenesis.

Here we demonstrate that {ZFP}809, a member of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein ({KRAB}-{ZFP}) family, initiates the silencing of {ERVs} in a sequence-specific manner via recruitment of heterochromatin-inducing complexes. {ZFP}809 knockout mice display highly elevated levels of {ZFP}809-targeted {ERVs} in somatic tissues. {ERV} reactivation is accompanied by an epigenetic shift from repressive to active histone modifications but only slight destabilization of {DNA} methylation.

Finally, we show that the {DNA}-binding specificity of {ZFP}809 is evolutionarily conserved in the Muroidea superfamily of rodents and predates the endogenization of retroviruses presently targeted by {ZFP}809 in Mus musculus. In sum, these data provide compelling evidence that {ZFP}809 evolved to recognize foreign {DNA} and establish histone modification-based epigenetic silencing of {ERVs}.},

These are the glial cell-specific transcription of {JC} virus which is controlled by the glial cell specific {POU} factor Tst-1; the regulation of human papillomavirus gene expression in the cervix by positively and negatively acting {POU} factors and the manner in which the balance between lytic or latent infection with {HSV} is controlled by positively and negatively acting {POU} factors which differ in their ability to interact with the virally encoded transactivator {VP}16.

Like {MEME}-{ChIP}, {XSTREME} performs two types of de novo motif discovery, and also performs motif enrichment analysis of the input sequences using databases of known motifs. Unlike {MEME}-{ChIP}, which ranks motifs based on their enrichment in the centers of the input sequences, {XSTREME} uses enrichment anywhere in the sequences for this purpose. Consequently, {XSTREME} is more appropriate for motif-based analysis of sequences regardless of how the motifs are distributed within the sequences. {XSTREME} uses the {MEME} and {STREME} algorithms for motif discovery, and the recently developed {SEA} algorithm for motif enrichment analysis. The interactive {HTML} output produced by {XSTREME} includes highly accurate motif significance estimates, plots of the positional distribution of each motif, and histograms of the number of motif matches in each sequences. {XSTREME} is easy to use via its web server at https://meme-suite.org, and is fully integrated with the widely-used {MEME} Suite of sequence analysis tools, which can be freely downloaded at the same web site for non-commercial use.},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

{RESULTS}: We provide a prediction of interacting {TFs} in 22 human tissues based on their {DNA}-binding affinity in promoter regions. We analyze all possible pairs of 130 vertebrate {TFs} from the {JASPAR} database. First, all human promoter regions are scanned for single {TF}-{DNA} binding affinities with {TRAP} and for each {TF} a ranked list of all promoters ordered by the binding affinity is created. We then study the similarity of the ranked lists and detect candidates for {TF}-{TF} interaction by applying a partial independence test for multiway contingency tables. Our candidates are validated by both known protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}) and known gene regulation mechanisms in the selected tissue. We find that the known {PPIs} are significantly enriched in the groups of our predicted {TF}-{TF} interactions (2 and 7 times more common than expected by chance). In addition, the predicted interacting {TFs} for studied tissues (liver, muscle, hematopoietic stem cell) are supported in literature to be active regulators or to be expressed in the corresponding tissue.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The findings from this study indicate that tissue-specific gene expression is regulated by one or two central regulators and a large number of {TFs} interacting with these central hubs. Our results are in agreement with recent experimental studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Chromatin organization has been increasingly studied in relation with its important influence on {DNA}-related metabolic processes such as replication or regulation of gene expression. Since its original design ten years ago, capture of chromosome conformation (3C) has become an essential tool to investigate the overall conformation of chromosomes. It relies on the capture of long-range trans and cis interactions of chromosomal segments whose relative proportions in the final bank reflect their frequencies of interactions, hence their spatial proximity in a population of cells. The recent coupling of 3C with deep sequencing approaches now allows the generation of high resolution genome-wide chromosomal contact maps. Different protocols have been used to generate such maps in various organisms. This includes mammals, drosophila and yeast. The massive amount of raw data generated by the genomic 3C has to be carefully processed to alleviate the various biases and byproducts generated by the experiments. Our study aims at proposing a simple normalization procedure to minimize the influence of these unwanted but inevitable events on the final results.

Results
Careful analysis of the raw data generated previously for budding yeast S. cerevisiae led to the identification of three main biases affecting the final datasets, including a previously unknown bias resulting from the circularization of {DNA} molecules. We then developed a simple normalization procedure to process the data and allow the generation of a normalized, highly contrasted, chromosomal contact map for S. cerevisiae. The same method was then extended to the first human genome contact map. Using the normalized data, we revisited the preferential interactions originally described between subsets of discrete chromosomal features. Notably, the detection of preferential interactions between {tRNA} in yeast and {CTCF}, {PolII} binding sites in human can vary with the normalization procedure used.

Conclusions
We quantitatively reanalyzed the genomic 3C data obtained for S. cerevisiae, identified some of the biases inherent to the technique and proposed a simple normalization procedure to analyse them. Such an approach can be easily generalized for genomic 3C experiments in other organisms. More experiments and analysis will be necessary to reach optimal resolution and accuracies of the maps generated through these approaches. Working with cell population presenting highest levels of homogeneity will prove useful in this regards.},

	abstract = {Background
{LINE}-1 (L1) is the dominant category of transposable elements in placental mammals. L1 has significantly affected the size and structure of all mammalian genomes and understanding the nature of the interactions between L1 and its mammalian host remains a question of crucial importance in comparative genomics. For this reason, much attention has been dedicated to the evolution of L1. Among the most studied elements is the mouse L1 which has been the subject of a number of studies in the 1980s and 1990s. These seminal studies, performed in the pre-genomic era when only a limited number of L1 sequences were available, have significantly improved our understanding of L1 evolution. Yet, no comprehensive study on the evolution of L1 in mouse has been performed since the completion of this genome sequence.

Results
Using the Genome Parsing Suite we performed the first evolutionary analysis of mouse L1 over the entire length of the element. This analysis indicates that the mouse L1 has recruited novel 5’{UTR} sequences more frequently than previously thought and that the simultaneous activity of non-homologous promoters seems to be one of the conditions for the co-existence of multiple L1 families or lineages. In addition the exchange of genetic information between L1 families is not limited to the 5’{UTR} as evidence of inter-family recombination was observed in {ORF}1, {ORF}2, and the 3’{UTR}. In contrast to the human L1, there was little evidence of rapid amino-acid replacement in the coiled-coil of {ORF}1, although this region is structurally unstable. We propose that the structural instability of the coiled-coil domain might be adaptive and that structural changes in this region are selectively equivalent to the rapid evolution at the amino-acid level reported in the human lineage.

Conclusions
The pattern of evolution of L1 in mouse shows some similarity with human suggesting that the nature of the interactions between L1 and its host might be similar in these two species. Yet, some notable differences, particularly in the evolution of {ORF}1, suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in host-L1 interactions might be different in these two species.},

The stability of the nucleosome and the factor-{DNA} complex have been determined, and in addition a minimum value for the affinity of the histone octamer has been computed. We find that in simple competition the {IBF} can successfully compete, only if the substrate {DNA} is shorter than 140 bp.

	abstract = {Cooperative binding of transcription factors ({TFs}) to promoters and other regulatory regions is essential for precise gene expression. The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between {TFs}, thus constraining the arrangement of {TF} sites in regulatory regions. Recent genomic and functional studies, however, demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of {TF} sites located in cis-regulatory regions. Such flexibility is inconsistent with cooperativity by direct interactions between {TFs}. Here, we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among noninteracting {TFs} can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is analogous to cooperativity in another multimolecular complex: hemoglobin. This surprising analogy provides deep insights, with parallels between the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g., the Bohr effect) and the roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene expression. Nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is consistent with several experimental studies, is equally applicable to repressors and activators, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of regulatory regions, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in transcriptional regulation point to a general mechanism that can be used in various biological systems.},

Recent advances in genome analysis and engineering have facilitated systematic interrogation of the regulatory activities of {TEs}. In this Review, we discuss diverse mechanisms by which {TEs} contribute to transcription regulation. Notably, {TEs} can donate enhancer and promoter sequences that influence the expression of host genes, modify 3D chromatin architecture and give rise to novel regulatory genes, including non-coding {RNAs} and transcription factors. We discuss how {TEs} spur regulatory evolution and facilitate the emergence of genetic novelties in mammalian physiology and development. By virtue of their repetitive and interspersed nature, {TEs} offer unique opportunities to dissect the effects of mutation and genomic context on the function and evolution of cis-regulatory elements. We argue that {TE}-centric studies hold the key to unlocking general principles of transcription regulation and evolution.},

Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for predicting nucleosome occupancies and an experimental protocol with appropriate spike-in normalization that confirms our theory and provides accurate occupancy levels over an MNase digestion time course. As with human cells, we observe no overall differences in nucleosome occupancies between Drosophila euchromatin and heterochromatin, which implies that heterochromatic compaction does not reduce MNase accessibility of linker DNA.},

Despite the potential role for {IAPs} in gene regulation, the precise genomic locations where these elements are integrated are not well understood. To address this issue, we have identified more than 400 novel {IAP} insertion sites within/near annotated genes by searching the murine genome, which suggests that the impact of {IAP} elements on local and/or global gene regulation could be more profound than was previously expected. On the basis of our independent analyses and already published reports, here we argue that {IAPs} and {ERV} elements in general could have an evolutionary role for modulating phenotypic plasticity upon environmental inputs, and that this could be mediated through specific stages of embryonic development such as placentation during which the epigenetic constraints on {IAP} elements are partially relaxed.},

	abstract = {Background
Functional and morphological studies of tandem DNA repeats, that combine high portion of most genomes, are mostly limited due to the incomplete characterization of these genome elements. We report here a genome wide analysis of the large tandem repeats (TR) found in the mouse genome assemblies.

Results
Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified large TR with array size more than 3 kb in two mouse whole genome shotgun (WGS) assemblies. Large TR were classified based on sequence similarity, chromosome position, monomer length, array variability, and GC content; we identified four superfamilies, eight families, and 62 subfamilies - including 60 not previously described. 1) The superfamily of centromeric minor satellite is only found in the unassembled part of the reference genome. 2) The pericentromeric major satellite is the most abundant superfamily and reveals high order repeat structure. 3) Transposable elements related superfamily contains two families. 4) The superfamily of heterogeneous tandem repeats includes four families. One family is found only in the WGS, while two families represent tandem repeats with either single or multi locus location. Despite multi locus location, TRPC-21A-MM is placed into a separated family due to its abundance, strictly pericentromeric location, and resemblance to big human satellites., To confirm our data, we next performed in situ hybridization with three repeats from distinct families. TRPC-21A-MM probe hybridized to chromosomes 3 and 17, multi locus TR-22A-MM probe hybridized to ten chromosomes, and single locus TR-54B-MM probe hybridized with the long loops that emerge from chromosome ends. In addition to in silico predicted several extra-chromosomes were positive for TR by in situ analysis, potentially indicating inaccurate genome assembly of the heterochromatic genome regions.

Conclusions
Chromosome-specific TR had been predicted for mouse but no reliable cytogenetic probes were available before. We report new analysis that identified in silico and confirmed in situ 3/17 chromosome-specific probe TRPC-21-MM. Thus, the new classification had proven to be useful tool for continuation of genome study, while annotated TR can be the valuable source of cytogenetic probes for chromosome recognition.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes cluster together when chromatin folds in the cell to form heterogeneous groups termed "clutches". These structural units add another level of chromatin regulation, for example during cell differentiation. Yet, the mechanisms that regulate their size and compaction remain obscure. Here, using our chromatin mesoscale model, we dissect clutch patterns in fibers with different combinations of nucleosome positions, linker histone density, and acetylation levels to investigate their role in clutch regulation. First, we isolate the effect of each chromatin parameter by studying systems with regular nucleosome spacing; second, we design systems with naturally-occurring linker lengths that fold onto specific clutch patterns; third, we model gene-encoding fibers to understand how these combined factors contribute to gene structure. Our results show how these chromatin parameters act together to produce different-sized nucleosome clutches. The length of nucleosome free regions ({NFRs}) profoundly affects clutch size, while the length of linker {DNA} has a moderate effect. In general, higher linker histone densities produce larger clutches by a chromatin compaction mechanism, while higher acetylation levels produce smaller clutches by a chromatin unfolding mechanism. We also show that it is possible to design fibers with naturally-occurring {DNA} linkers and {NFRs} that fold onto specific clutch patterns. Finally, in gene-encoding systems, a complex combination of variables dictates a gene-specific clutch pattern. Together, these results shed light into the mechanisms that regulate nucleosome clutches and suggest a new epigenetic mechanism by which chromatin parameters regulate transcriptional activity via the three-dimensional folded state of the genome at a nucleosome level.},

Concurrent recent developments in all these areas have enabled researchers to image the genome with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. In this review, we focus on what single-molecule imaging and tracking of individual proteins in live cells have taught us about chromatin structure and dynamics. Starting with the basics of single-molecule tracking ({SMT}), we describe some advantages over in situ imaging techniques and its current limitations. Next, we focus on single-nucleosome studies and what they have added to our current understanding of the relationship between chromatin dynamics and transcription. In celebration of Robert Feulgen’s ground-breaking discovery that allowed us to start seeing the genome, we discuss current models of chromatin structure and future challenges ahead.},

	abstract = {The positioning of nucleosomes relative to {DNA} and their neighboring nucleosomes represents a fundamental layer of chromatin organization. Changes in nucleosome positioning and spacing affect the accessibility of {DNA} to regulatory factors and the formation of higher order chromatin structures. Sequencing of mononucleosomal fragments allowed mapping nucleosome positions on a genome-wide level in many organisms. This revealed that successions of evenly spaced and well-positioned nucleosomes-so called phased nucleosome arrays-occur at the 5' end of many active genes and in the vicinity of transcription factor and other protein binding sites. Phased arrays arise from the interplay of barrier elements on the {DNA}, which position adjacent nucleosomes, and the nucleosome spacing activity of {ATP}-dependent chromatin remodelers. A shortcoming of classic mononucleosomal mapping experiments is that they only reveal nucleosome spacing and array regularity at select sites in the genome with well-positioned nucleosomes. However, new technological approaches elucidate nucleosome array structure throughout the genome and with single-cell resolution. In the future, it will be interesting to see whether changes in nucleosome array regularity and spacing contribute to the formation of higher order chromatin structures and the spatial organization of the genome in vivo.},

Here, we review the mechanisms behind the establishment of this primary structure of chromatin with special emphasis on the biogenesis of evenly spaced nucleosome arrays. We highlight the roles that transcription, nucleosome remodelers, {DNA} sequence, and histone density play towards the formation of evenly spaced nucleosome arrays and summarize our current understanding of their cellular functions.

	abstract = {CTCF is crucial for chromatin structure and transcription regulation in early embryonic development. However, the kinetics of CTCF chromatin occupation in preimplantation embryos have remained unclear. In this study, we used CUT\&RUN technology to investigate CTCF occupancy in mouse preimplantation development. Our findings revealed that CTCF begins binding to the genome prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), with a preference for CTCF-anchored chromatin loops. Although the majority of CTCF occupancy is consistently maintained, we identified a specific set of binding sites enriched in the mouse-specific short interspersed element (SINE) family B2 that are restricted to the cleavage stages. Notably, we discovered that the neuroprotective protein ADNP counteracts the stable association of CTCF at SINE B2-derived CTCF-binding sites. Knockout of Adnp in the zygote led to impaired CTCF binding signal recovery, failed deposition of H3K9me3, and transcriptional derepression of SINE B2 during the morula-to-blastocyst transition, which further led to unfaithful cell differentiation in embryos around implantation. Our analysis highlights an ADNP-dependent restriction of CTCF binding during cell differentiation in preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, our findings shed light on the functional importance of transposable elements (TEs) in promoting genetic innovation and actively shaping the early embryo developmental process specific to mammals.},

This intrinsic nucleosomal ordering strongly correlates with oscillations in the local {GC} content as well as with the interspecies and intraspecies mutation profiles, revealing the existence of both positive and negative selection. In this letter, we show that these predicted nucleosome inhibitory energy barriers ({NIEBs}) with compacted neighboring nucleosomes are indeed ubiquitous to all vertebrates tested. These 1 kb-sized chromatin patterns are widely distributed along vertebrate chromosomes, overall covering more than a third of the genome. We have previously observed in human deviations from neutral evolution at these genome-wide distributed regions, which we interpreted as a possible indication of the selection of an open, accessible, and dynamic nucleosomal array to constitutively facilitate the epigenetic regulation of nuclear functions in a cell-type-specific manner. As a first, very appealing observation supporting this hypothesis, we report evidence of a strong association between {NIEB} borders and the poly(A) tails of Alu sequences in human. These results suggest that {NIEBs} provide adequate chromatin patterns favorable to the integration of Alu retrotransposons and, more generally to various transposable elements in the genomes of primates and other vertebrates.},

There are many different types of retrotransposon in mammalian genomes, and these target different points in germline development to amplify and integrate into new genomic locations. Germ cells, and their pluripotent developmental precursors, have evolved a variety of genome defence mechanisms that suppress retrotransposon activity and maintain genome stability across the generations. Here, we review recent advances in understanding how retrotransposon activity is suppressed in the mammalian germline, how genes involved in germline genome defence mechanisms are regulated, and the consequences of mutating these genome defence genes for the developing germline.},

	abstract = {Chromosomal architecture is known to influence gene expression, yet its role in controlling cell fate remains poorly understood. Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by the transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC offers an opportunity to address this question but is severely limited by the low proportion of responding cells. We have recently developed a highly efficient reprogramming protocol that synchronously converts somatic into pluripotent stem cells. Here, we used this system to integrate time-resolved changes in genome topology with gene expression, TF binding and chromatin-state dynamics. The results showed that TFs drive topological genome reorganization at multiple architectural levels, often before changes in gene expression. Removal of locus-specific topological barriers can explain why pluripotency genes are activated sequentially, instead of simultaneously, during reprogramming. Together, our results implicate genome topology as an instructive force for implementing transcriptional programs and cell fate in mammals.},

	abstract = {Chromatin plays a pivotal role in genome expression, maintenance, and replication. To better understand chromatin organization, we developed a novel proximity-tagging method which assigns unique DNA barcodes to molecules that associate in 3D space. Using this method – Proximity Copy Paste (PCP) – we mapped the connectivity of individual nucleosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By analyzing nucleosome positions and spacing on single molecule fibers, we show that chromatin is predominantly organized into regularly spaced nucleosome arrays that can be positioned or delocalized. Basic features of nucleosome arrays are generally explained by gene size and transcription. PCP can also map long-range, multi-way interactions and we provide the first direct evidence supporting a model that metaphase chromosomes are compacted by cohesin loop clustering. Analyzing single-molecule nuclease footprinting data we define distinct chromatin states within a mixed population to show that non-canonical nucleosomes, notably Overlapping-Di-Nucleosomes (OLDN) are a stable feature of chromatin. PCP is a versatile method allowing the detection of the connectivity of individual molecules locally and over large distance to be mapped at high-resolution in a single experiment.},

A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT\&RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT\&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT\&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only {\textasciitilde}1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT\&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT\&RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution.

This model, however, is supported by in vitro binding studies of a limited number of sequences. To study CTCF multivalency in vivo, we define ZF binding requirements at {\textasciitilde}50,000 genomic sites in primary lymphocytes. We find that CTCF reads sequence diversity through ZF clustering. ZFs 4–7 anchor CTCF to {\textasciitilde}80\% of targets containing the core motif. Nonconserved flanking sequences are recognized by ZFs 1–2 and ZFs 8–11 clusters, which also stabilize CTCF broadly. Alternatively, ZFs 9–11 associate with a second phylogenetically conserved upstream motif at {\textasciitilde}15\% of its sites. Individually, ZFs increase overall binding and chromatin residence time. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered a conserved downstream DNA motif that destabilizes CTCF occupancy. Thus, CTCF associates with a wide array of DNA modules via combinatorial clustering of its 11 ZFs.},

Sox2 was previously thought to be the sole Sox protein expressed in mouse embryonic stem ({ES}) cells. Sox2 associates with Oct3/4 to maintain self-renewal of {ES} cells. In the current study, digital differential display identified transcripts for an additional Sox family member, Sox15, enriched in mouse {ES} cells. Reverse transcription-{PCR} confirmed that Sox15 expression is highest in undifferentiated {ES} cells and repressed upon differentiation. Sox15 is expressed at low levels in several tissues, including testis and muscle. In vitro studies showed that Sox15, like Sox2, associated with Oct3/4 on {DNA} sequences containing the octamer motif and Sox-binding site. Gel mobility shift assays and {SELEX} analyses showed that Sox15 binds similar {DNA} sequences as Sox2 but with weaker affinity. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality observed in Sox2-null mice, Sox15-null {ES} cells and mice were grossly normal. {DNA} microarray analyses revealed that Otx2, Ctgf, Ebaf, and Hrc are dysregulated in Sox15-null {ES} cells, however. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Sox15, but not Sox2, bound to a Sox consensus binding site within the Hrc gene. Taken together, these data demonstrate differential roles for Sox15 and Sox2 in transcriptional control in mouse {ES} cells.},

New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals.

First, we define three classes of promoters with distinct transcriptional directionality and pausing properties that correlate with their {GC} content. We further analyze the direct influence of {GC} content on nucleosome positioning and depletion and show that {CpG} content and {CGI} width correlate with nucleosome depletion both in vivo and in vitro. We also show that transcription is not essential for nucleosome exclusion but influences both a weak +1 and a well-positioned nucleosome at {CGI} borders.

While they are frequently mutated in cancer, it remains largely unclear how the four mammalian remodeler families ({SWI}/{SNF}, {ISWI}, {CHD} and {INO}80) orchestrate the global organization of nucleosomes. To gain insight into this matter, we generated viable embryonic stem cells that lack Snf2h, the {ATPase} of {ISWI} complexes, enabling to study its cellular function and contrast it to Brg1, the {ATPase} of {SWI}/{SNF}. Loss of Snf2h decreases nucleosomal phasing and increases linker lengths providing in vivo evidence for {ISWI} function in ruling nucleosomal spacing in mammals. Systematic analysis of transcription factor binding reveals their selective requirement on either remodeling activity. One group critically depends on Brg1 and contains the transcriptional repressor {REST}, while a non-overlapping set relies on Snf2h and includes the insulator protein {CTCF}. This selectivity readily explains why chromosomal folding and insulation of topologically associated domains requires Snf2h, but not Brg1., Collectively, this study shows that mammalian {ISWI} is critical for nucleosomal periodicity and nuclear organization and that transcription factors rely on specific remodeling pathways for proper genomic binding.},

	abstract = {{SETDB}1 is an essential histone methyltransferase that deposits histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) to transcriptionally repress genes and repetitive elements. The function of differential H3K9me3 enrichment between cell-types remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate mutual exclusivity of H3K9me3 and {CTCF} across mouse tissues from different developmental timepoints. We analyze {SETDB}1 depleted cells and discover that H3K9me3 prevents aberrant {CTCF} binding independently of {DNA} methylation and H3K9me2. Such sites are enriched with {SINE} B2 retrotransposons. Moreover, analysis of higher-order genome architecture reveals that large chromatin structures including topologically associated domains and subnuclear compartments, remain intact in {SETDB}1 depleted cells. However, chromatin loops and local 3D interactions are disrupted, leading to transcriptional changes by modifying pre-existing chromatin landscapes. Specific genes with altered expression show differential interactions with dysregulated cis-regulatory elements. Collectively, we find that cell-type specific targets of {SETDB}1 maintain cellular identities by modulating {CTCF} binding, which shape nuclear architecture and transcriptomic networks.},

Consequently, a growing number of computational tools have been designed to identify repetitive elements in an ab initio manner, i.e. without using prior sequence data. Here we present the results of side-by-side evaluations of six of the most widely used ab initio repeat finding programs. Using sequence from rice chromosome 12, tools were compared with regard to time requirements, ability to find known repeats, utility in identifying potential novel repeats, number and types of repeat elements recognized and compactness of family descriptions. The study reveals profound differences in the utility of the tools with some identifying virtually their entire substrate as repetitive, others making reasonable estimates of repetition, and some missing almost all repeats. Of note, even when tools recognized similar numbers of repeats they often showed marked differences in the nature and number of repeat families identified. Within the context of this comparative study, {ReAS} and {RepeatScout} showed the most promise in analysis of sequence reads and assembled genomic regions, respectively. Our results should help biologists identify the program(s), if any, that is best suited for their needs.},

When analyzed at one-dimensional level, the billions of chromatin contacts from Footprint-C enable genome-wide analysis at single footprint resolution, and reveal preferential modes of local {TF} co-occupancy. At pairwise contact level, Footprint-C exhibits higher efficiency in identifying chromatin structural features when compared with other Hi-C methods, segregates chromatin interactions emanating from adjacent {TF} footprints, and uncovers multiway interactions involving different {TFs}. Altogether, Footprint-C results suggest that rich regulatory modes of {TF} may underlie both local residence and distal chromatin interactions, in terms of {TF} identity, valency, and conformational configuration.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          Accurate transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics requires the coordination and activity of chromatin-associated proteins ({CAPs}) at distinct loci. While the combinatorial activity of a select set of {CAPs} has been previously examined, these studies are limited by the underrepresentation of proteins and cell types explored, making it difficult to identify the global associations as well as the conservation of these associations across different cell types. Here, we performed 270 {CAP} chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing ({ChIP}-Seq) experiments in both K562 and {HepG}2 cancer cell lines and explored the relationship between cell identity and {CAP} co-association using three distinct approaches. We employed a machine learning algorithm to organize the genome-wide binding profiles into 56 and 70 interpretable co-association modules for {HepG}2 and K562 cell lines, respectively. We found {CAP} co-association modules are mostly cell type-specific, however those present in both cell lines are largely comprised of {TFs} from a single {TF} family and anchor to unique loci via lineage-specific factors. While enhancer-associated co-binding modules were largely composed of cell type-specific {CAPs}, we found regulatory activity at promoter-enhancer module contacts to be enriched for chromatin remodeling proteins. Additionally, we used colocalization information derived from co-association models in conjunction with neural network models of transcription factor ({TF}) activity to identify high-confidence candidate {TF} cooperative pairs. Finally, through comparing {CAP} enrichment in high occupancy target ({HOT}) regions in K562 and {HepG}2 cell lines, we found cell type-specific {HOT} sites, but not common {HOT} sites, are selectively enriched at high copy number loci. Overall, this study uncovers principles of sequence-level and large-scale {CAP} genomic organization and demonstrates how this contributes to cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions.},

Here we compared four different {TF} combinations that induce different cell states, analysing {TF} genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of {TFs}. When bound together, {TFs} act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels {TF} combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, {TFs} assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing {TF} combinatorial binding to enhancers.},

However, the evolution of metazoan cell types and their underlying gene regulatory programmes remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we use whole-organism single-cell RNA sequencing to map cell-type-specific transcription in Porifera (sponges), Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Placozoa species. We describe the repertoires of cell types in these non-bilaterian animals, uncovering diverse instances of previously unknown molecular signatures, such as multiple types of peptidergic cells in Placozoa. Analysis of the regulatory programmes of these cell types reveals variable levels of complexity. In placozoans and poriferans, sequence motifs in the promoters are predictive of cell-type-specific programmes. By contrast, the generation of a higher diversity of cell types in ctenophores is associated with lower specificity of promoter sequences and the existence of distal regulatory elements. Our findings demonstrate that metazoan cell types can be defined by networks of transcription factors and proximal promoters, and indicate that further genome regulatory complexity may be required for more diverse cell type repertoires.},

	abstract = {“Complex multicellularity,” conventionally defined as large organisms with many specialized cell types, has evolved five times independently in eukaryotes, but never within prokaryotes. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, most of which posit that eukaryotes evolved key traits (e.g., dynamic cytoskeletons, alternative mechanisms of gene regulation, or subcellular compartments) which were a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of complex multicellularity. Here, we propose an alternative, nonadaptive hypothesis for this broad macroevolutionary pattern. By binning cells into groups with finite genetic bottlenecks between generations, the evolution of multicellularity greatly reduces the effective population size (Ne) of cellular populations, increasing the role of genetic drift in evolutionary change. While both prokaryotes and eukaryotes experience this phenomenon, they have opposite responses to drift: eukaryotes tend to undergo genomic expansion, providing additional raw genetic material for subsequent multicellular innovation, while prokaryotes generally face genomic erosion. Taken together, we hypothesize that these idiosyncratic lineage-specific evolutionary dynamics play a fundamental role in the long-term divergent evolution of complex multicellularity across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold. How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics, and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future, high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

Integrating the analysis across all these scales is useful.There are two main methods of sequence comparison: scanning for regions of high sequence similarity above some operational threshold, and building statistical models of sequence families. Model-based sequence analysis can incorporate more biological knowledge than sequence similarity scans and provide more refined results.The output of most high-throughput functional genomics experiments can be treated as a continuous signal mapped onto the genome and analysed with a standardized signal processing approach.Signal processing involves smoothing the raw signal, then thresholding and segmenting the signal into discrete annotated blocks.Integration of multiple types of signals generates a progression of more and more complex annotations; these smaller annotations are clustered into groups and then into functional networks that begin to represent the state of biological knowledge about the genome.A chronic problem with annotation based on functional genomics data is the lack of sufficient validation by more low-throughput methods.Techniques such as paired-end sequencing and chromosome conformation capture (and its descendants) enable annotation of connectivity between elements and necessitate a move beyond the one-dimensional signal approach to annotation.},

Understanding these essential biological processes requires in-depth knowledge of how DNA complies to mechanical stress. Two important physical features of DNA, helical structure and sequence, are not incorporated in current descriptions of DNA elasticity. Here we connect well-defined force–extension measurements with a new model for DNA elasticity: the twistable worm-like chain, in which DNA is considered a helical, elastic entity that complies to tension by extending and twisting. In addition, we reveal hitherto unnoticed stick–slip dynamics during DNA overstretching at ∼65 pN, caused by the loss of base-pairing interactions. An equilibrium thermodynamic model solely based on DNA sequence and elasticity is presented, which captures the full complexity of this transition. These results offer deep quantitative insight in the physical properties of DNA and present a new standard description of DNA mechanics.},

	abstract = {The genetic code is nearly universal, and the arrangement of the codons in the standard codon table is highly non-random. The three main concepts on the origin and evolution of the code are the stereochemical theory, according to which codon assignments are dictated by physico-chemical affinity between amino acids and the cognate codons (anticodons); the coevolution theory, which posits that the code structure coevolved with amino acid biosynthesis pathways; and the error minimization theory under which selection to minimize the adverse effect of point mutations and translation errors was the principal factor of the code’s evolution. These theories are not mutually exclusive and are also compatible with the frozen accident hypothesis, i.e., the notion that the standard code might have no special properties but was fixed simply because all extant life forms share a common ancestor, with subsequent changes to the code, mostly, precluded by the deleterious effect of codon reassignment. Mathematical analysis of the structure and possible evolutionary trajectories of the code shows that it is highly robust to translational misreading but there are numerous more robust codes, so the standard code potentially could evolve from a random code via a short sequence of codon series reassignments. Thus, much of the evolution that led to the standard code could be a combination of frozen accident with selection for error minimization although contributions from coevolution of the code with metabolic pathways and weak affinities between amino acids and nucleotide triplets cannot be ruled out. However, such scenarios for the code evolution are based on formal schemes whose relevance to the actual primordial evolution is uncertain. A real understanding of the code origin and evolution is likely to be attainable only in conjunction with a credible scenario for the evolution of the coding principle itself and the translation system.},

The results showed a nucleosome-depleted region in the vicinity of GAA triplet-repeats in activated and resting CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the A-tract was frequently adjacent to the upstream region of GAA triplet-repeats and could enhance the depletion surrounding GAA triplet-repeats. In vitro chromatin reconstitution assays with GAA-containing plasmids also demonstrated that the inserted GAA triplet-repeats destabilized the ability of recombinant plasmids to assemble nucleosomes. Our results suggested that GAA triplet-repeats have lower affinity to histones and can change local nucleosome positioning.

	abstract = {Background
Chromatin organization has been increasingly studied in relation with its important influence on {DNA}-related metabolic processes such as replication or regulation of gene expression. Since its original design ten years ago, capture of chromosome conformation (3C) has become an essential tool to investigate the overall conformation of chromosomes. It relies on the capture of long-range trans and cis interactions of chromosomal segments whose relative proportions in the final bank reflect their frequencies of interactions, hence their spatial proximity in a population of cells. The recent coupling of 3C with deep sequencing approaches now allows the generation of high resolution genome-wide chromosomal contact maps. Different protocols have been used to generate such maps in various organisms. This includes mammals, drosophila and yeast. The massive amount of raw data generated by the genomic 3C has to be carefully processed to alleviate the various biases and byproducts generated by the experiments. Our study aims at proposing a simple normalization procedure to minimize the influence of these unwanted but inevitable events on the final results.

Results
Careful analysis of the raw data generated previously for budding yeast S. cerevisiae led to the identification of three main biases affecting the final datasets, including a previously unknown bias resulting from the circularization of {DNA} molecules. We then developed a simple normalization procedure to process the data and allow the generation of a normalized, highly contrasted, chromosomal contact map for S. cerevisiae. The same method was then extended to the first human genome contact map. Using the normalized data, we revisited the preferential interactions originally described between subsets of discrete chromosomal features. Notably, the detection of preferential interactions between {tRNA} in yeast and {CTCF}, {PolII} binding sites in human can vary with the normalization procedure used.

Conclusions
We quantitatively reanalyzed the genomic 3C data obtained for S. cerevisiae, identified some of the biases inherent to the technique and proposed a simple normalization procedure to analyse them. Such an approach can be easily generalized for genomic 3C experiments in other organisms. More experiments and analysis will be necessary to reach optimal resolution and accuracies of the maps generated through these approaches. Working with cell population presenting highest levels of homogeneity will prove useful in this regards.},

Cysteaminyl {EDTA} was tethered to a recombinant histone octamer via a mutant histone H4 with serine 47 replaced by cysteine. When assembled into nucleosome core particles, the {DNA} could be cut site specifically by hydroxyl radical-catalyzed chain scission by using the Fenton reaction. Strand cleavage occurs mainly at a single nucleotide close to the dyad axis of the core particle, and assignment of this location via the symmetry of the nucleosome allows base-pair resolution mapping of the histone octamer position on the {DNA}. The positions of the histone octamer and H3H4 tetramer were mapped on a 146-bp Lytechinus variegatus 5S {rRNA} sequence and a twofold-symmetric derivative. The weakness of translational determinants of nucleosome positioning relative to the overall affinity of the histone proteins for this {DNA} is clearly demonstrated. The predominant location of both histone octamer and H3H4 tetramer assembled on the 5S {rDNA} is off center. Shifting the nucleosome core particle position along {DNA} within a conserved rotational phase could be induced under physiologically relevant conditions. Since nucleosome shifting has important consequences for chromatin structure and gene regulation, an approach to the thermodynamic characterization of this movement is proposed. This mapping method is potentially adaptable for determining nucleosome position in chromatin in vivo.},

A prominent feature of {TAD} boundaries in mammalian genomes is the enrichment of clustered {CTCF} sites often with mixed orientations, which can either block or facilitate enhancer–promoter (E-P) interactions within or across distinct {TADs}, respectively. We will discuss recent progress in the understanding of fundamental organizing principles of the clustered {CTCF} insulator codes at {TAD} boundaries. Specifically, both inward- and outward-oriented {CTCF} sites function as topological chromatin insulators by asymmetrically blocking improper {TAD}-boundary-crossing cohesin loop extrusion. In addition, boundary stacking and enhancer clustering facilitate long-distance E-P interactions across multiple {TADs}. Finally, we provide a unified mechanism for {RNA}-mediated {TAD} boundary function via R-loop formation for both insulation and facilitation. This mechanism of {TAD} boundary formation and insulation has interesting implications not only on how the 3D genome folds in the Euclidean nuclear space but also on how the specificity of E-P interactions is developmentally regulated.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements are an abundant source of transcription factor binding sites, and favorable genomic integration may lead to their recruitment by the host genome for gene regulatory functions. However, it is unclear how frequent co-option of transposable elements as regulatory elements is, to which regulatory programs they contribute and how they compare to regulatory elements devoid of transposable elements. Here, we report a transcription initiation-centric, in-depth characterization of the transposon-derived regulatory landscape of mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that a substantial number of transposable element insertions, in particular endogenous retroviral elements, are associated with open chromatin regions that are divergently transcribed into unstable {RNAs} in a cell-type specific manner, and that these elements contribute to a sizable proportion of active enhancers and gene promoters. We further show that transposon subfamilies contribute differently and distinctly to the pluripotency regulatory program through their repertoires of transcription factor binding site sequences, shedding light on the formation of regulatory programs and the origins of regulatory elements.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes serve as the basic structural components of chromatin and act as key regulators of gene expression and cellular function. In this study, we compared the nucleosome occupancy, distribution, and transcription of genes between two types of cells: fully grown germinal vesicle ({GV}) oocytes from big follicles ({BF}) and somatic cells (porcine embryonic fibroblast, {PEF}). The nucleosome occupancy in the {BF} promoter was significantly higher than in {PEF}. A reanalysis of published transcriptomes of fully grown {GV} oocytes and {PEF} identified 51 uniquely expressed genes in {BF} and 80 in {PEF}. The nucleosome distribution around gene transcription start sites ({TSSs}) correlated with expression levels in somatic cells, but results differed between {BF} and {PEF}. This research reveals the dynamic changes and crucial roles of nucleosome positioning and chromatin organization in different cell types, providing a theoretical basis for nuclear transplantation., (1) Background: Nucleosomes represent the essential structural units of chromatin and serve as key regulators of cell function and gene expression. Oocytes in the germinal vesicle ({GV}) stage will later undergo meiosis and become haploid cells ready for fertilization, while somatic cells undergo mitosis after {DNA} replication. (2) Purpose: To furnish theoretical insights and data that support the process of cell reprogramming after nuclear transplantation. (3) Methods: We compared the nucleosome occupancy, distribution, and transcription of genes between two types of cells: fully grown {GV} oocytes from big follicles ({BF}) and somatic cells (porcine embryonic fibroblast, {PEF}). (4) Results: The nucleosome occupancy in the promoter of {BF} was 4.85\%, which was significantly higher than that of 3.3\% in {PEF} (p {\textless} 0.05), and the nucleosome distribution showed a noticeable increase surrounding transcriptional start sites ({TSSs}) in {BF}. Next, we reanalyzed the currently published transcriptome of fully grown {GV} oocytes and {PEF}, and a total of 51 genes in {BF} and 80 genes in {PEF} were identified as being uniquely expressed. The nucleosome distribution around gene {TSSs} correlated with expression levels in somatic cells, yet the results in {BF} differed from those in {PEF}. (5) Conclusion: This study uncovers the dynamic nature and significance of nucleosome positioning and chromatin organization across various cell types, providing a basis for nuclear transplantation.},

	abstract = {Nucleosome positioning and mobility, which plays an important role in gene expression and regulation, is in turn modulated by {DNA} sequence and its underlying mechanical properties. The free energy, required to deform a 147 bp linear {DNA} fragment into a nucleosomal configuration, is a way to quantify {DNA} mechanical propensity for nucleosome formation. This work explores how such energy, referred to as the nucleosome wrapping energy, is altered by {DNA} sequence mutations and epigenetic modifications. The nucleosome wrapping energy is computed using a newly developed computational method based on minimising the {cgNA}+ coarse-grain model energy with elastic constraints on phosphate positions. We find that the effect of sequence mutations and epigenetic modifications is highly dependent on the positions along the sequence of the modified bases. Most point mutations as well as cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation, depending on their positions, can lead both to an increase and decrease in the nucleosome wrapping energy. We use the data of mutation-caused energy changes to identify sequence patterns in specific positions, leading to the smallest and highest wrapping energy values. Furthermore, we construct sequences corresponding to extremely low and high nucleosome wrapping energies, compared to energy distribution for human genome sequences. We believe that our findings are helpful for better understanding the role of {DNA} sequence and its epigenetic modifications in nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, our constructed minimum energy sequence could be used as a candidate for producing stable synthetic nucleosomes.},

Specifically, application of this method enables the resolution of cell-selective promoter and enhancer architectures on single fibers, including transcription factor footprinting and position mapping, with sequence-specific fixation of nucleosome arrays flanking transcription start sites and regulatory motifs. We uncover haplotype-specific chromatin patterns, multiple regulatory elements cis-aligned on individual fibers, and accessible chromatin at 20,000 unique sites encompassing retrotransposons and other repeat sequences hitherto "unmappable" by short-read epigenomic sequencing. Overall, we show that Fiber-seq is applicable to human brain tissue, offering sharp demarcation of nucleosome-depleted regions at sites of open chromatin in conjunction with multi-kilobase nucleosomal positioning at single-fiber resolution on a genome-wide scale.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes, the building block of chromatin, are responsible for regulating access to the {DNA} sequence. This control is critical for essential cellular processes, including transcription and {DNA} replication and repair. Studying chromatin can be challenging both in vitro and in vivo, leading many to use a mono-nucleosome system to answer fundamental questions relating to chromatin regulators and binding partners. However, the mono-nucleosome fails to capture essential features of the chromatin structure, such as higher-order chromatin folding, local nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, and linker {DNA} trajectory and flexibility. We briefly review significant discoveries enabled by the mono-nucleosome and emphasize the need to go beyond this model system in vitro. Di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleosome arrays can answer important questions about chromatin folding, function, and dynamics. These multi-nucleosome arrays have highlighted the effects of varying linker {DNA} lengths, binding partners, and histone post-translational modifications in a more chromatin-like environment. We identify various chromatin regulatory mechanisms yet to be explored with multi-nucleosome arrays. Combined with in-solution biophysical techniques, studies of minimal multi-nucleosome chromatin models are feasible.},

The stability of cell identity relies on robust mechanisms that maintain the epigenome and chromatin accessibility to transcription factors. Pioneer factors counter these mechanisms to implement new cell fates through binding of DNA target sites in closed chromatin and introduction of active-chromatin histone modifications, primarily at enhancers. As master regulators of enhancer activation, pioneers are thus crucial for the implementation of correct cell fate decisions in development, and as such, they hold tremendous potential for therapy through cellular reprogramming. The power of pioneer factors to reshape the epigenome also presents an Achilles heel, as their misexpression has major pathological consequences, such as in cancer. In this Review, we discuss the emerging mechanisms of pioneer factor functions and their roles in cell fate specification, cellular reprogramming and cancer.},

In contrast to earlier views of nucleosome arrays as uniformly regular and folded, recent findings reveal heterogeneous array organization and diverse modes of folding.
