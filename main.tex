Les nucléosomes, unités fondamentales de la chromatine, enroulent l’ADN et participent à la fois à l’architecture du génome et à la régulation génique. Si la séquence d’ADN influence leur positionnement in vitro, son impact in vivo reste limité\cite{valouev_determinants_2011}. Le modèle de barrière\cite{mavrich_barrier_2008} propose une organisation autour d’un nucléosome bien positionné. Nous introduisons un modèle de « génome ponctué », dans lequel des régions de positionnement (Nucleosome Positioning Regions, NPRs) induisent la formation de nucléosomes phasés ou de régions dépourvues de nucléosomes (Nucleosome Depleted Regions, NDRs). Ces NPRs incluent facteurs de transcription, répétitions dispersées et microsatellites.

En suivant l’approche développée chez la levure (Routhier et al., 2021), nous avons entraîné un modèle de deep learning interprétable sur le génome murin, afin d’extraire des règles prédictives adaptées aux génomes de grande taille. Les réseaux neuronaux convolutifs (CNN) sont bien adaptés pour capturer des caractéristiques multi-échelles, des k-mers aux motifs et à leurs combinaisons. Nous avons utilisé des cartes de positionnement nucléosomique en cellules souches embryonnaires murines (mESC), issues de deux méthodes complémentaires : 

(1) MNase-seq, basé sur la digestion de l’ADN linker mais limité par des biais enzymatiques \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019} ; 

(2) Clivage chimique, qui modifie les histones pour cliver l’ADN via un système cuivre/$H_2O_2$, réduisant ces biais \cite{voong_insights_2016}.

L’apprentissage sur un génome riche en séquences répétées ($_sim$60 \%) impose d’éviter le sur-apprentissage tout en conservant leur information. Nous avons filtré les régions à faible couverture/cartographiabilité puis évalué les prédictions par mutagenèse in silico, générant une carte de scores à la paire de bases. Ces scores ont été analysés avec XSTREME \cite{grant_xstreme_2021} et complétés par des expériences de génomique synthétique pour tester directement l’effet des éléments identifiés.

Le modèle retrouve des déterminants connus, comme CTCF, puissant inducteur de phasage nucléosomique \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019, lai_principles_2018}. Sa capacité à phaser dépend de la conservation du motif et d’un pré-motif en amont, et notre approche distingue précisément les motifs effectivement liés, validés par ChIP-seq. De façon inattendue, nous identifions la famille SP/KLF comme nouveaux contributeurs au phasage. Nous montrons aussi que certains éléments répétitifs dispersés participent activement à l’organisation : certains SINEs, porteurs de motifs CTCF, agissent comme points de phasage \cite{schmidt_waves_2012}, tandis que les LINEs et LTR contribuent également, suggérant un rôle structurel plus large des répétitions dans la chromatine des mammifères. Enfin, les microsatellites révèlent des signatures de positionnement dépendant de leur séquence, renforçant leur potentiel régulateur.

Ainsi, notre approche de deep learning interprétable met en évidence une logique combinatoire où facteurs de transcription, répétitions dispersées et microsatellites structurent l’organisation nucléosomique dans les génomes complexes.

\large Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, wrap DNA and contribute both to genome architecture and gene regulation. While DNA sequence influences nucleosome positioning in vitro, its impact in vivo remains limited\cite{valouev_determinants_2011}. The barrier model\cite{mavrich_barrier_2008} proposes an organization centered around a well-positioned nucleosome. Here, we introduce a “punctuated genome” model, in which Nucleosome Positioning Regions (NPRs) promote the formation of phased nucleosome arrays or nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs). These NPRs include transcription factors, dispersed repeats, and microsatellites.

Following the approach developed in yeast\cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}, we trained an interpretable deep learning model on the mouse genome to extract predictive rules applicable to large genomes. \Gls{cnn} are well suited to capture multi-scale genomic features, from short k-mers to motifs and their combinations. We used nucleosome maps from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) obtained with two complementary methods: 

(1) MNase-seq, based on linker DNA digestion but limited by enzymatic bias \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019}; 

(2) Chemical cleavage, which modifies histones to cleave DNA via a copper/$H_2O_2$ system, thereby reducing such biases \cite{voong_insights_2016}.

Training on a genome rich in repetitive sequences ($sim$60 \%) required strategies to avoid overfitting while retaining informative content. We filtered out regions of low coverage/mappability and evaluated predictions using in silico mutagenesis, generating base-pair resolution score maps. These scores were analyzed with XSTREME \cite{grant_xstreme_2021} and complemented with synthetic genomics experiments to directly test the effect of identified elements.

Our model recovers known determinants such as CTCF, a strong inducer of nucleosome phasing \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019, lai_principles_2018} . Its phasing capacity depends on motif conservation and the presence of an upstream pre-motif, and our approach accurately distinguishes motifs bound in vivo, as confirmed by ChIP-seq. Unexpectedly, we identify the SP/KLF family as novel contributors to nucleosome phasing. We also show that certain dispersed repeats actively participate in chromatin organization: some SINEs carrying CTCF motifs act as phasing points \cite{schmidt_waves_2012}, while LINEs and LTRs also contribute, suggesting a broader structural role of repeats in mammalian chromatin. Finally, microsatellites display sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning patterns, reinforcing their regulatory potential.

Thus, our interpretable deep learning approach highlights a combinatorial logic in which transcription factors, dispersed repeats, and microsatellites collectively shape nucleosome organization in complex genomes.

\chapter{The Genome: Structure, Function, and Organization}
The genome is the complete set of information that encodes the structure and function of cells, tissues, and the organism as a whole. Deoxyribonucleic acid (\gls{dna}) is a long, double-stranded molecule that stores the information for cell phenotype and more generally, whole organism for multicellular. in the form of a chemical code. Each strand is composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone, to which nitrogenous bases (also called nucleotides) adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are attached. The two strands wind around each other to form a double helix, a structure famously revealed by Rosalind Franklin\cite{franklinEvidence2ChainHelix1953}.
\gls{dna} is ubiquitous in all organisms and serves as the universal medium for storing genetic information, each cell carry at least a copy of this genome which can be free of organize in a nucleus. This information is transcribed into \gls{rna}, which differs from \gls{dna} by its chemical composition, as its nucleotides contain a ribose sugar and uracil instead of thymine, and is mostly found in single-stranded form. This \gls{rna} is then translated into chains of amino acids that fold into proteins. These proteins perform a wide range of structural and functional roles at every level of biological organization. Remarkably, the genetic code that governs this flow of transcription and translation is nearly identical across all forms of life\cite{kooninOriginEvolutionGenetic2009}.

\section{Multicellular genomes are gene-sparse}
The central characteristic of living organisms is reproduction, which ensures the continuity of life across generations. A fundamental challenge of reproduction is the faithful duplication of genetic material. In unicellular organisms, cell division by mitosis allows both the preservation and the propagation of the organism, as each division produces a new, independent cell. In multicellular organisms, by contrast, reproduction usually involves meiosis, which generates gametes with half the genetic content, later restored at fertilization. In both contexts, replication in its broadest sense (the accurate copying of genetic material) remains essential, as it underpins both cellular continuity and the transmission of hereditary information.

In unicellular organisms, each cell functions independently and will replicate again in full autonomy. In contrast, multicellular organisms are composed of cells that assemble into tissues, organs, and ultimately the whole organism. These cells are specialized and no longer operate autonomously. This raises a fundamental question: how can different cell types, all carrying the same genetic material, acquire distinct phenotypes and cooperate to sustain the organism’s global biological functions ?
In multicellular organisms, specialization arises from stem cells which could basically adopt any phenotype. This process, also known as cell fate determination, is a finely tuned mechanism that programs each cell with a specific set of expressed proteins, thereby defining its phenotype. Genome regulation is both qualitative and quantitative: certain proteins are absent from specific cell types, while others are ubiquitous but expressed at different levels depending on the cell type.

Genomes can be broadly characterized by the number of genes they contain and their overall length. Intuitively, one might expect that genome length scales proportionally with gene number across species. However, in multicellular organisms, this correlation breaks down: genome size increases dramatically without a corresponding rise in gene count.

This observation allows us to distinguish between:

(1) Compact genomes, in which a large proportion of the DNA sequence codes for genes such as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where coding sequences represent approximately 70\% of the genome\cite{alexanderAnnotatingNoncodingRegions2010a} and up to 97\% for some bacterial genomes\cite{landInsights20Years2015}.

(2) Gene-sparse genomes, typical of multicellular organisms, where intergenic and intronic regions dominate, with 1.2\% of coding regions for the human genome\cite{omennReflectionsHUPOHuman2021}.\\
The gene-sparsity of complex genomes is thought to reflect the need for sophisticated and flexible gene regulation such as enhancers, silencers, and insulators, enabling cellular differentiation and the emergence of diverse cell types\cite{sebe-pedrosEarlyMetazoanCell2018}.

Indeed, the expansion of non-coding regions may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of multicellularity\cite{binghamNonadaptiveExplanationMacroevolutionary2024}.
Two major factors have been proposed to explain the expansion of genomes in multicellular organisms: whole-genome duplications and the proliferation of repetitive elements.
Whole-genome duplications provide raw material for evolutionary innovation by creating gene redundancy, which can lead to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. This process facilitates the emergence of new regulatory and developmental functions, potentially supporting the evolution of complex multicellularity\cite{vandepeerEvolutionarySignificanceAncient2009}. Phylogenetic studies on early metazoans show that critical transcription factors required for development are highly conserved and predate the divergence of modern animal lineages. However, subsequent genome expansions, together with the retention of multiple gene copies, enabled parallel evolution and the co-option of duplicated genes for new functions \cite{larroux_genesis_2008} such as the well-studied POU \cite{phillips_virtuoso_2000} and Sox families \cite{wilson_matching_2002}. This increase in the repertoire of transcription factors allowed a refinement of gene regulation and the emergence of highly specialized cell phenotypes, suggesting that genome expansion was one of the key drivers of multicellularity.

Repetitive elements, particularly transposable elements, represent a substantial fraction of many eukaryotic genomes. Beyond their contribution to genome size, these sequences can be co-opted as regulatory elements, such as enhancers or insulators\cite{chuong_regulatory_2017}, and shape chromatin architecture, allowing long range regulation\cite{cournac_3d_2016}. Their expansion is therefore thought to play a critical role in increasing genome size \cite{schartl_genomes_2024}, therefore potential regulatory complexity, which is essential for cell differentiation and tissue specialization. We will return later to their contribution to higher-order chromatin structures such as domains and compartments.

In both cases, genome expansion is ultimately constrained by nuclear volume and can only occur in parallel with efficient chromatin compaction, thereby placing nucleosome positioning as a central determinant of genome expansion, evolutionary innovation, and genomic complexity.

%\section{The central role of the nucleosome in chromatin}
\section{Anatomy of the chromatin}
DNA in the nucleus is not found in a naked form, but rather is packaged with histone-proteins to form a complex structure known as chromatin. Chromatin plays a key role in regulating gene accessibility and genome stability. Its fundamental unit is the nucleosome, which consists of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The dynamic organization of chromatin allows the genome to be compacted to fit within the nucleus while still enabling precise control over gene expression, replication, and repair.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Persistence length, colframe=pink, colback=pink!10!white,coltitle=black, breakable, fonttitle=\bfseries]
The persistence length is a basic mechanical property quantifying the bending stiffness of a polymer. While it is rigorously defined using the polymer's diameter, Young's modulus, and bending stiffness, it can be simply understood as the typical length scale over which the polymer's deflection is negligible, and appears straight. Below this length, the polymer resists bending and behaves like a rigid rod. Beyond it, thermal fluctuations become strong enough to introduce noticeable bends, so the polymer starts to look flexible and can eventually fold back or cross over itself. A famous example of this property is the extreme (and theoretically estimated) $10^{18}$ m persistence length of 
uncooked spaghetti \cite{guinea_brittle_2004}, meaning that spaghetti will always break before bending,
even at very large scales. It is often insightful to compare a polymer’s persistence length to its actual contour length, as this ratio determines whether the polymer behaves more like a flexible thread or a stiff rod. In the same spirit, raw \gls{dna} has a large persistence length ($\sim$500 Å, depending on the sequence) compared to its 
diameter (20 Å) \cite{grossQuantifyingHowDNA2011a,zheng_how_2010}, making it effectively a rigid polymer at its scale.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Nucleosomes handle chromatin compaction}
Each cell of our organism carries a copy of the genome, which is stored in the cell nucleus. This constitutes a real physical challenge, as a stretched copy of the entire genome in mammals can reach several meters in length, while the cell nucleus is only about 10~µm in diameter. On top of that, \gls{dna} has a relatively high persistence length among natural polymers (see text box).

Living organisms have developed different strategies for \gls{dna} compaction. In this process, eukaryotes differ from viruses or bacteria by relying on histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) to assist with DNA compaction \cite{teif_condensed_2011}. These proteins assemble into an octamer to form the so-called nucleosome. \Gls{dna} wraps around the nucleosome core particle in 1.65 turns of a 147-bp left-handed helix. On top of this wrapping, successive nucleosomes can assemble into higher-order structures, stabilized by the linker histone H1. H1 binds near the nucleosome dyad (the central base pair where the DNA entry and exit points are symmetric) and simultaneously contacts the two linker DNAs, forming a stem-like structure that reduces their flexibility and promotes a regular trajectory of nucleosomes in the fiber \cite{bednar_structure_2017}. This higher-order structure achieves a compaction ratio between 30 and 40, meaning that one micrometer of chromatin fiber contains 30–40 micrometers of naked DNA \cite{luger_crystal_1997}.

The \gls{nrl} is defined as the average distance between the centers of two adjacent nucleosomes, \textit{i.e.}, the sum of the 147~bp of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer and the linker DNA connecting consecutive nucleosomes. It provides a simple metric to describe the large-scale organization of chromatin and reflects how tightly nucleosomes are packaged along the genome. The NRL typically ranges between 165 and 220~bp. Variations in \gls{nrl} have been linked to differences in cell type, developmental state, and histone H1 occupancy, and thus it is widely used as a quantitative descriptor of chromatin compaction and accessibility \cite{teif_genome-wide_2012,beshnova_regulation_2014,clarkson_ctcf-dependent_2019}.

\subsection{The spatial and temporal organization of the genome}
The genome is not a static linear molecule, but a dynamic and spatially organized entity. The concept of the 4D genome refers to the integration of three-dimensional genome architecture with its temporal dynamics across the cell cycle, development, and environmental responses.

First, chromatin is not uniformly packed. Spatial studies of the nucleus have revealed two major chromatin states, organized into megabase-scale compartments. Compartment A is mostly accessible, enriched in transcriptionally active regions, and is generally associated with euchromatin. In contrast, compartment B is densely packed, enriched in silent genomic regions with tight DNA-DNA interactions, and is generally associated with heterochromatin \cite{lieberman-aiden_comprehensive_2009,bonev_organization_2016}. Compartments can be subdivided on a finer scale. Topologically Associated Domains (\gls{tad}) are contiguous regions with a median size of $\sim$880 kbp that are enriched in internal contacts \cite{rao_3d_2014}. Unlike compartments, \glspl{tad} are conserved across cell types and can switch between compartments \cite{dixon_chromatin_2016}. This spatial organization plays a critical role in gene regulation by facilitating or restricting interactions between enhancers, promoters, and other regulatory elements. Advances in techniques such as Hi-C or Micro-C are now revealing how the genome folds, unfolds, and rearranges to coordinate complex gene regulatory programs in space.

Over time, cells progress through different phases known as the cell cycle. For most of it, the cell is in an interphase state, during which transcription and genome regulation are active. During interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases), the genome is actively transcribed, replicated, and regulated, while maintaining a relatively open chromatin organization\cite{probst_epigenetic_2009}. In contrast, during mitosis chromatin undergoes maximal condensation and extensive rearrangement into visible chromosomes. This global reorganization leads to a loss of accessibility and transcriptional silencing, as most regulatory factors are displaced. Nevertheless, some histone modifications and transcription factors remain bound, a process known as mitotic bookmarking, which facilitates the rapid reactivation of transcriptional programs in daughter cells\cite{festuccia_transcription_2019}.

A multitude of molecular machineries govern multidimensional genome organization, including transcription factors and their complexes, chromatin remodelers, and the replication machinery. While these factors interact with nucleosomes and influence their positioning, in this thesis we focus specifically on sequence determinants, acknowledging that they act in concert with the broader epigenetic and regulatory landscape.

\subsection{Nucleosomes in genome regulation}
\label{subsec:genom_reg}
Genome regulation refers to the control of gene activity. Genes can be active, inactive, or expressed at intermediate levels, depending on the action of protein complexes that enhance or repress their expression. Transcription requires the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the \gls{tss}. To achieve this, transcription factors bind to enhancer regions and recruit chromatin remodelers that shape the chromatin to make it accessible to other transcription factors and to the \gls{pic}, including RNA polymerase II. Enhancer regions can be located proximally (within hundreds of base pairs) or at long distances, sometimes over megabases \cite{soutourina_transcription_2018}. Spatial studies discussed previously showed that these interaction (even the distant one) occurs in 
\glspl{tad}, which loop-shaped region of chromatin, extruded through cohesin-CTCF complex\cite{lieberman-aiden_comprehensive_2009}.
The initiation of the transcription requires the effective binding of transcription factors to the \gls{dna}, therefore chromatin accessibility. Nucleosome perturbation at the \gls{tss} can both repress or activate the transcription by influencing the \gls{pic} formation on particular genes\cite{ichikawa_sequence-directed_2016,lai_understanding_2017}. This represents the most intuitive regulatory function of nucleosomes: by physically restricting access to DNA, they can modulate the binding of transcription factors and the activity of the transcriptional machinery.

Beyond their structural role, nucleosomes also carry epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation, methylation, or ubiquitination, that act as regulatory signals. These histone marks can either activate or repress gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility or recruiting chromatin-associated complexes \cite{bannister_regulation_2011, allis_molecular_2016}. In this way, nucleosomes not only organize the genome spatially but also encode regulatory information that contributes to gene expression programs. Several well-characterized histone modifications that illustrate how nucleosomes integrate structural and regulatory functions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:epigenetic_marks}.

Altogether, these mechanisms highlight that nucleosomes act not only as packaging units but also as dynamic regulators of genome function, bridging DNA sequence, chromatin organization, and transcriptional control



\section{Repeated elements in sparse genomes}
This study broadly addresses repeated elements, which constitute over 60\% of the mouse genome \cite{smit_afa_hubley_r_green_p_repeatmasker_1996}. Once dismissed as genomic "junk", these sequences are now increasingly recognized for their functional roles in transcriptional regulation \cite{jiang_role_2021} and 3D chromatin architecture \cite{cournac_3d_2016}. Inherited from ancient mobile elements, some of these repeats have proliferated and contributed to regulatory innovation \cite{schmidt_waves_2012, bakoulis_endogenous_2022}. Repeats can be broadly classified into two categories: transposable elements and satellite DNA.

\subsection{From parasitism to partnership: the dual nature of transposable elements}
\glspl{te} constitute a major fraction of the repetitive genome and play a dual role as both drivers of genetic innovation and sources of genomic instability. First dicovered in maize by Barbara Mc Clintock\cite{mcclintock_origin_1950}, they propagate through two distinct mechanisms.  
Retrotransposons (class I) follow a "copy-and-paste" mechanism: they are transcribed into \gls{rna}, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and reintegrated into the genome.  
DNA transposons (class II), in contrast, move through a "cut-and-paste" process, excising themselves from one genomic locus and inserting into another \cite{bourque_ten_2018}. The main transposable elements families are described in Table~\ref{tab:TE_structures}.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Historically dismissed as genomic parasites due to their self-replicating nature, TEs are now recognized as key regulators of genome function, particularly in development and cell identity \cite{chuong_regulatory_2017}. Their relationship with the host genome is shaped by an evolutionary conflict: while unchecked TE activity can threaten genome integrity, their insertional diversity also provides a rich substrate for regulatory innovation.

\glspl{te} can profoundly influence genome function and organismal fitness through a cascade of effects ranging from local gene regulation to broader impacts on cellular phenotype \cite{chuong_regulatory_2017}. Upon integration, a \gls{te} may disrupt coding sequences, alter regulatory landscapes, or introduce new cis-regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, or insulators. While many TE insertions are neutral and ultimately lost through random mutation, deleterious insertions often impair cellular function and are eliminated through negative selection. In some cases, however, harmful insertions can persist if they are epigenetically silenced by the host. Finally, a subset of insertions may acquire beneficial regulatory activity and be retained by positive selection. This dynamic interplay between loss, repression, and co-option contributes to the recurrent evolutionary turnover of regulatory sequences.

To mitigate the potential threat of uncontrolled TE activity, host genomes have evolved layers of epigenetic repression. In \gls{mesc}, distinct TE families are marked by specific histone modifications that determine their transcriptional potential. For instance, H3K9me3 is typically associated with constitutive silencing of older, inactive TEs, whereas younger elements with regulatory potential may carry marks of active or poised chromatin such as H3K27ac or H3K4me1 \cite{he_transposable_2019}.

A prominent example of this repression occurs with the young murine L1Md \gls{line} family. The promoters found on 5' present tandem repeated monomers, their number and sequence composition vary between subfamilies \cite{zhou_subtype_2019}, but they often harbor multiple short motifs capable of recruiting transcription factors (e.g. YY1, RUNX3, SOX) and influencing transcription initiation \cite{elmer_genomic_2021}. Two observations highlight why repression is necessary yet must be timed. In somatic contexts, loss of H3K9me3-based repression at intronic L1Md perturbs nearby gene programs (observed during chemiotherapy or ionization) \cite{pelinski_nf-b_2022}. Conversely, a brief, coding-independent burst of LINE-1 activity after fertilization promotes global chromatin accessibility, whereas premature silencing or prolonged activation are deleterious \cite{jachowicz_line-1_2017}. This stage-dependent logic helps explain how TE sequences can later be co-opted as \textit{bona fide} regulatory modules.

In some cases, the regulatory properties of \gls{te} have been co-opted by the host genome. \Gls{te}-derived sequences can be stably integrated into gene regulatory networks, especially during development, where they serve as alternative enhancers or promoters, and may even contribute to species-specific traits. This interplay between repression, innovation, and selection makes \glspl{te} both a threat and a source of evolutionary novelty. \Glspl{erv} stand out for their regulatory potential in mESCs. While most are transcriptionally silenced, a subset remains accessible and carries active histone marks. Their \gls{ltr}, including solo \glspl{ltr}, are frequently bound by core pluripotency factors such as OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, and can act as alternative promoters or enhancers \cite{bakoulis_endogenous_2022}. These regulatory activities, though initially incidental, have been co-opted by the host genome to shape transcriptional programs during early development \cite{chuong_regulatory_2017}.

One well-studied example of such co-option involves the SINE B2 family of retrotransposons. These elements can harbor CTCF motifs and thereby act as boundary elements that limit the expansion of active chromatin domains \cite{ichiyanagi_b2_2021}. Their regulatory influence, however, is strongly modulated by the epigenetic environment: enrichment in repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3 can silence B2 motifs, preventing their activity as chromatin borders and thus safeguarding the genome against uncontrolled regulatory interference \cite{gualdrini_h3k9_2022}.

On an evolutionary scale, \gls{te} expansions have contributed to the rewiring of genome architecture and regulatory networks. In mammals, lineage-specific insertions can create novel transcription factor binding sites and alter chromatin organization. In the mouse genome, Schmidt et al. demonstrated that SINE B2 elements are particularly enriched for newly acquired CTCF binding sites \cite{schmidt_waves_2012}. These insertions have introduced functional CTCF motifs that reshape chromatin loops, illustrating how waves of \gls{te} activity (in this case, B2 SINEs) may remodel the three-dimensional genome organization in rodents.

In summary, TEs represent a dynamic and versatile component of the genome. Once viewed as selfish DNA, they are now increasingly seen as partners in gene regulation, whose activity is modulated by a finely tuned balance of conflict, repression, and evolutionary co-option.

\subsection{Functional Implications of Satellite DNA and Microsatellites in Genome Architecture}
Satellite DNA refers to tandemly repeated sequences, predominantley located in heterochromatic regions such as centromeres and telomeres. Based on the size of the repeat unit, they are classified into satellites, minisatellites, and microsatellites. Though once dismissed as inert DNA, satellite repeats are now known to play key roles in chromatin compaction, centromere identity, and genome integrity \cite{biscotti_repetitive_2015}. Because the mm10 genome assembly does not provide a telomere-to-telomere reconstruction, centromeric and telomeric regions remain poorly annotated, precluding detailed analysis of satellite DNA at these loci. Nevertheless, other families of \gls{tr} are present in the assembly; a prominent example is the LINE-1 \gls{te}-derived tandem repeat formed by part of the ORF2 and the 3’LTR \cite{komissarov_tandemly_2011}.
%Nevertheless, we observed striking patterns associated with microsatellites—short tandem repeats (1–6bp) scattered throughout the genome—which have received little attention in the context of chromatin organization and nucleosome positioning.

Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are highly polymorphic and prone to replication slippage, making them valuable as genetic markers.  
Recent studies have highlighted their multifaceted roles in genome biology, including modulation of transcription factor binding, spacing of regulatory elements, cytosine methylation, alternative splicing, mRNA stability, transcriptional initiation and termination, unusual secondary structures, nucleosome positioning and modification, higher-order chromatin organization, non-coding RNA production, and meiotic recombination hotspots \cite{bagshaw_functional_2017}.

\end{figure}


\section{Experimental methods for nucleosome positioning}
Nucleosome positioning plays a crucial role in understanding how chromatin structure influences gene regulation and genome folding. Since the first biochemical and electron microscopy evidence of nucleosome arrangement in chromatin by Compton et al. in 1976 \cite{comptonBiochemicalElectronmicroscopicEvidence1976}, the study of nucleosome positioning has become a central topic in molecular biology. Over the decades, a wide range of experimental and computational methods have been developed to characterize how nucleosomes are distributed along the genome.
The increasing interest in this topic is illustrated by the growing number of scientific publications over the years (Figure~\ref{fig:query_nucpos}). 

\subsection{Microscopy}
The first evidence of nucleosome particles on \gls{dna} was observed using electron microscopy \cite{olins_spheroid_1974}, and their regular arrangement was later confirmed through similar techniques \cite{comptonBiochemicalElectronmicroscopicEvidence1976}. This gave rise to the "beads-on-a-string" model, suggesting that the genome was "remarkably uniform and simple" \cite{kornberg_structure_1977}.
Since then, observing nucleosomes has remained a technical challenge, but microscopy techniques have continuously improved, offering increasingly higher resolution.
Over the past decade, many long-held assumptions about chromatin structure have been overturned. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that nucleosomes are not evenly positioned across the genome, but rather form small, heterogeneous clusters termed “nucleosome clutches”, interspersed throughout the chromatin \cite{ricci_chromatin_2015}. Furthermore, regular spacing or higher-order folding, such as the classical 30 nm fiber, has been shown to occur only in vitro under specific conditions, and no evidence of this kind of chromatin structure has been found in vivo \cite{nishino_human_2012, ricci_chromatin_2015, baldi_beads_2020}.

\subsection{MNase-sequencing}
Several molecular biology techniques have been developed to map nucleosome positioning genome-wide. Among the most widely used is MNase-seq (Micrococcal Nuclease digestion followed by sequencing), which takes advantage of the nucleosome’s ability to protect the underlying \gls{dna} from enzymatic digestion. The resulting protected \gls{dna} fragments, typically around 147 base pairs in length, are then sequenced and mapped to infer nucleosome positions with high resolution \cite{yuanGenomescaleIdentificationNucleosome2005, kaplanDNAencodedNucleosomeOrganization2009}. Figure~\ref{fig:mnase_graphabstract} provides a simplified illustration of this principle. In actual experiments, remaining fragments are filtered to retain nucleosome-sized fragments, typically between 130 and 200 base pairs.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/Introduction/mnase_graphabstract.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Graphical abstract of MNase-seq assay}. \Gls{dna}-linkers are digested by MNase while the nucleosomal fragments remains intact and are then sequenced. Created with Bio-render}
    \label{fig:mnase_graphabstract}
\end{figure}

This technique presents certain limitations, as micrococcal nuclease exhibits sequence preferences, particularly favoring AT-rich regions and underrepresenting GC-rich DNA \cite{chungEffectMicrococcalNuclease2010}. Furthermore, chromatin compaction is highly heterogeneous, especially between heterochromatin (tightly packed) and euchromatin (loosely organized), making it difficult to capture nucleosome positions with uniform accuracy. In compact regions, limited enzymatic accessibility may lead to underrepresentation, while "fragile" nucleosomes, which are highly sensitive to digestion, may be lost under standard conditions. To address these issues and improve genome-wide consistency, some authors have implemented digestion gradients, varying enzyme concentration or exposure time to better capture nucleosome occupancy across chromatin states \cite{cherejiQuantitativeMNaseseqAccurately2019}.
The work presented in this manuscript is based on the deep MNase-seq data published by Festuccia et al and processed by Luis Altamirano from Pablo Navarro Gil's team at Institut Pasteur \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019} which provided both an experimental signal uniquely-mapped and multi-mapped (see box).

\vspace{1em}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Genome coverage and mappability, colframe=pink, colback=pink!10!white,coltitle=black, breakable, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\label{box:mappability}
    Mappability quantifies how uniquely a $k$-mer can be mapped within a given genome. It is a key metric used to identify genomic regions where reads may align ambiguously. 
    At each genomic position $p$, the mappability score is defined as the inverse of the number of occurrences of the $k$-mer starting at $p$ in the genome; that is,
    \[
    \text{Mappability}(p) = \left( \#\left\{ \text{genomic matches of } \text{sequence}[p:p+k] \right\} \right)^{-1}
    \]
    
    A major challenge when studying mammal DNA is the difficulty of mapping small reads in some parts of the genome due to the highly represented repeated elements (low mappability). Using a signal resulting from reads that map uniquely to the genome will result in non covered region. One strategy to overcome this limitation is to allow ambiguous mapping by randomly attributing the read to one of the best match.
    
    In our context, as the MNase-seq data were generated using Illumina technology, mappability was computed for 150-mers across the genome (k=150).
\end{tcolorbox}
\vspace{1em}

\subsection{Chemical Cleavage}
Chemical cleavage mapping, which relies on targeted hydroxyl radical cleavage near histones via copper-mediated reactions, enables high-resolution nucleosome positioning by directly probing DNA–histone contacts \cite{brogaard_chapter_2012}. This technique was developed to overcome some of the limitations of MNase-seq, particularly its sequence bias and sensitivity to digestion conditions. Notably, Voong et al. (2017) demonstrated that chemical cleavage can recover fragile nucleosomes that are typically lost with MNase digestion \cite{voong_genome-wide_2017}. However, the method requires genetically modifying cells to express the H4S47C histone variant (substituting serine 47 with cysteine on histone H4 to allow copper tagging) and involves substantial computational processing to accurately reconstruct nucleosome maps.
The experimental data published by Voong et al. have been used to train the chemical cleavage model.

\subsection{Histone ChIP-seq}
\gls{chipseq} uses antibodies to target specific protein and enable to retrieve their positiong using sequencing. Leveraging the structure of nucleosome which is an octamer of histones, it is possible to use \gls{chipseq} on histone. This approach is way less resolutive than MNase-seq or Chemical cleavage but it is interesting to flag active and inactive region if the \gls{chipseq} targets epigenetics modification on histones.

\subsection{Transposase-based method}
ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a fast and sensitive technique to map open chromatin regions using Tn5 transposase. While primarily used to identify accessible regulatory regions, fragment size distribution can indirectly inform nucleosome positioning: short fragments (<100bp) correspond to nucleosome-free regions, whereas mononucleosome-sized fragments (around 150bp) indicate protected DNA. Although less precise than MNase-seq or chemical cleavage for nucleosome mapping, ATAC-seq remains widely used due to its simplicity and suitability for low-input and single-cell applications \cite{buenrostro_transposition_2013}.

CUT\&RUN (Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease) and CUT\&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation) are antibody-directed methods enabling high-resolution mapping of protein–DNA interactions. In CUT\&RUN, a protein A\textendash\allowbreak micrococcal nuclease fusion is recruited to chromatin by a specific antibody and selectively cleaves DNA adjacent to the bound protein, releasing fragments into solution for sequencing \cite{skene_efficient_2017}.
CUT\&Tag follows a similar principle but employs a protein A–Tn5 fusion that simultaneously cleaves and inserts sequencing adapters at antibody-bound sites, streamlining library preparation and reducing background \cite{kaya-okur_cuttag_2019}. Both methods require fewer cells and produce higher signal-to-noise ratios than ChIP-seq, making them valuable tools for profiling transcription factors, histone modifications, and chromatin-associated proteins with minimal input.

\subsection{Single molecule nucleosome occupancy}
\gls{nomeseq} uses a GpC methyltransferase to probe chromatin accessibility before bisulfite conversion, providing a simultaneous readout of nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at single-molecule resolution \cite{kellyGenomewideMappingNucleosome2012}. This method relies on the principle that accessible regions of DNA (those not occupied by nucleosomes or bound proteins) are methylated by the exogenous enzyme. After bisulfite conversion and sequencing, unmethylated GpC sites indicate protected regions, whereas methylated sites correspond to accessible DNA.
NOMe-seq is particularly powerful because it captures both nucleosome positioning and endogenous CpG methylation in the same molecule, thus linking chromatin structure with epigenetic state. It has been applied in various contexts, including cancer epigenomics and early development, where chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation play crucial regulatory roles.

PCP (Proximity Copy-Paste) assigns unique DNA barcodes to DNA segments that are in 3D proximity on the same long molecule, enabling single-molecule readout of nucleosome positions, spacing, and long-range connectivity \cite{delamarre_chromatin_2025}. By proximity-tagging and copying barcode sequences across contacting regions on an intact fiber, PCP preserves both the linear order of nucleosomes and their higher-order associations on a single read. 
In practice, it resolves regularly spaced arrays that can be positioned or delocalized, detects multi-way long-range contacts consistent with loop clustering, and reveals non-canonical particles such as overlapping di-nucleosomes, all within one experiment.

Both approaches resolve chromatin at the single-molecule (long-read) scale: PCP captures physical connectivity and fiber architecture, whereas NOMe-seq captures accessibility and epigenetic state. 
Importantly, PCP does not sequence native ultra-long reads directly; instead, it uses proximity barcoding to reconstruct continuous single-molecule fibers at long-read scale, which still entails technically demanding library preparation, stringent controls, and dedicated reconstruction and analysis pipelines.


\subsection{Adaptations to single-cell resolution}
Recent advances have enabled the adaptation of nucleosome mapping techniques to single-cell resolution, revealing chromatin heterogeneity across individual cells. Techniques such as single-cell MNase-seq, scATAC-seq, and single-cell NOMe-seq have been developed to capture nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility in individual nuclei. These approaches offer insights into cell-to-cell variability in chromatin structure and gene regulation, which are especially relevant in developmental biology, cancer, and tissue complexity.
However, single-cell methods often suffer from sparse coverage and increased technical noise, requiring careful computational processing and aggregation to extract meaningful patterns. Despite these limitations, they represent a critical step toward understanding genome organization at the cellular level.

\subsection{Medical perspective of nucleosome studies}
This emergence of experimental methods show the interest of the community for nucleosome positioning studies (Figure~\ref{fig:query_nucpos}) which is a central and fundamental question to better grasp the genome regulation and refine the global knownledge of life sciences. However the study of nucleosome is also of clinical interset. Deep sequencing of \gls{cfdna} found in plasma has been used to infer nucleosome footprints. Snyder et al. (2016) demonstrated that it is possible to retrieve the cell type of origin from sequenced \gls{cfdna} and to generate a genome-wide nucleosome density map \cite{snyderCellfreeDNAComprises2016}. This technique is minimally invasive and holds great potential for the diagnosis of cancer-related disorders \cite{penny_chromatin_2024, tejerina-miranda_determining_2025} or sepsis
\cite{su_circulating_2024, garcia-gimenez_circulating_2025}.

\newpage
\section{Computational methods for nucleosome positioning}
In addition to the diverse experimental techniques developed to map nucleosome positions genome-wide, a growing number of computational tools have been introduced to predict nucleosome occupancy directly from DNA sequence. In 2016, Vladimir Teif catalogued nineteen online tools dedicated to the theoretical prediction of nucleosome positioning, reflecting the increasing interest in sequence-based modeling approaches \cite{teif_nucleosome_2016}. These tools span a wide range of methodologies, including statistical mechanics, DNA bendability models, and machine learning algorithms. Since then, the number of available resources has continued to grow, with more than forty computational tools now accessible for either analyzing experimental data or predicting intrinsic nucleosome formation probabilities from sequence alone. This proliferation of tools highlights the complexity of nucleosome positioning and the need for integrative approaches that combine biophysical principles with high-throughput data analysis. A curated and regularly updated list of these resources is maintained by the Gene Regulation Teif Lab, offering a valuable reference for researchers navigating this evolving landscape \cite{shtumpf_nucposdb_2022}.

\subsection{Sequence-based models}
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, early computational efforts aimed to identify consensus high-affinity sequences for nucleosomes by aligning nucleosome-bound \gls{dna} \cite{satchwell_sequence_1986}. However, these alignment-based approaches failed to uncover a clear canonical motif, highlighting the degenerate and context-dependent nature of nucleosomal DNA, but they revealed sequence composition preferences and periodic features such as dinucleotide periodicity. Later improvements in sequence alignment algorithms confirmed the absence of a motif and the presence of dinucleotide preferences \cite{wang_improved_2005}.

This limitation prompted a shift toward statistical modeling approaches, which aimed to capture the complex and subtle sequence features associated with nucleosome affinity. Rather than searching for a strict consensus, these models evaluated how local sequence composition, dinucleotide frequencies, and periodic patterns contribute to nucleosome formation. A key advance came with the work of Segal et al. (2006), who developed a probabilistic model trained on \textit{in vitro} reconstituted nucleosomes, incorporating 5-mer statistics and periodic filters to predict nucleosome occupancy across the genome \cite{segal_genomic_2006}. This approach was later extended by Kaplan et al. (2009), who used genome-wide \textit{in vitro} reconstitution data to refine sequence-based predictions and systematically compare them to \textit{in vivo} nucleosome maps, thus highlighting the interplay between DNA-encoded signals and trans-acting regulatory mechanisms \cite{kaplanDNAencodedNucleosomeOrganization2009}. This statistical framework provided key insights into the sequence determinants of nucleosome occupancy. Yet, because it does not explicitly model the mechanics of DNA deformation, it leaves unanswered questions about the physical feasibility of nucleosome formation at predicted sites. To address this, a complementary line of research grounded in biophysical principles has emerged.

\subsection{Statistical positioning models}
Building upon early theoretical work such as the Tonks gas model \cite{tonks_complete_1936}, which states that gas particles along a one-dimensional lattice will exhibit density oscillations around an obstacle, Kornberg et al. proposed the idea of nucleosome statistical positioning \cite{kornberg_statistical_1988}. In this view, the genome harbors barriers against which nucleosomes stack and position according to Tonks’ principle. This simple model was applied and confirmed in yeast MNase-seq data \cite{mavrich_barrier_2008, mobius_quantitative_2010}. However, later studies showed that the barrier model alone, as an interaction-free framework, was not sufficient to fully explain nucleosome positioning. Nucleosome–nucleosome interactions were demonstrated to be necessary to fit experimental data, and refinements such as a two-body potential \cite{chereji_statistical_2011} or an explicit attractive force between nucleosomes \cite{riposo_nucleosome_2012} were proposed.

The statistical positioning model is now challenged because it relies on assumptions about the location of chromatin barriers and is not sufficient to explain nucleosome positioning without incorporating nucleosome–nucleosome interactions. Nevertheless, it still remains a good average model, especially in yeast, where gene-dense genomes present regularly positioned \gls{tss}, explaining the majority of nucleosome positioning.


\subsection{Biophysical models}
Biophysical models aim to predict nucleosome positioning by simulating the physical and chemical constraints that govern the interaction between DNA and histone proteins. These models typically rely on principles from polymer physics, electrostatics, and structural biology to estimate the energetic cost of wrapping DNA around the histone octamer at specific loci.

One class of models, based on DNA elasticity, treats the double helix as a deformable polymer and quantifies the bending energy required to accommodate the superhelical path imposed by the nucleosome. Building upon the idea that dinucleotides position nucleosomes because of the intrinsic physical properties of \gls{dna}, Miele developed a nucleosome positioning model using only sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and intrinsic curvature \cite{miele_dna_2008}. The addition of histone–DNA interactions allowed DNABEND to refine sequence-specific energy landscapes \cite{morozov_using_2009}. These elasticity-based models are complemented by structure-based methods, which derive atomistic interaction potentials from high-resolution nucleosome crystal structures \cite{battistini_structure-based_2012}. Other approaches incorporate chromatin packing constraints, such as \gls{nrl} or steric hindrance, into energetic models of nucleosome arrays \cite{zhang_packing_2011, xi_predicting_2010}. Monte Carlo simulations have also been used to explore nucleosome arrangement at the population level by simulating nucleosome exclusion and spacing constraints in the presence of experimental occupancy data \cite{schopflin_modeling_2013}. Probabilistic extensions of these models have emerged more recently. For instance, HiddenFoot integrates single-molecule footprinting data with a biophysical formalism (using thermodynamical principles) to infer nucleosome and transcription factor occupancy at base-pair resolution \cite{dalakishvili_biophysical_2025}.

Despite their mechanistic interpretability, biophysical models face important limitations. Many models rely on equilibrium thermodynamics and neglect the inherently dynamic nature of chromatin, including the activity of ATP-dependent remodelers and transcriptional processes \cite{jiang_role_2021}. Energy models trained on specific sequence or structural features may not generalize across different cell types, species, or chromatin contexts. Incorporating genome-wide experimental data (e.g., MNase-seq) into these frameworks often entails high computational cost and susceptibility to experimental noise. The influence of transcription factors, histone modifications, and chromatin boundaries remains difficult to integrate explicitly and requires additional biophysical assumptions. In response to these challenges, recent efforts have turned to deep learning approaches. Neural network–based models bypass the need for explicit feature engineering by learning complex, nonlinear relationships directly from DNA sequence. These models can capture a broader spectrum of regulatory signals and outperform traditional models in predicting nucleosome occupancy, particularly in complex, cell-type-specific chromatin environments.



\subsection{Machine learning approach}
Machine learning refers to a broad set of computational techniques that enable mathematical models to learn from data. Instead of defining explicit rules, these methods infer patterns and structures automatically by optimizing model parameters. Common approaches include decision trees, which split data based on informative features; k-means clustering, which groups similar data points without labels; and linear or logistic regression, which model relationships between variables. These models are used for tasks such as classification, prediction, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Their simplicity and interpretability make them widely applicable across domains, from biology to economics.
Among this techniques, the breakthrough of neural networks enabled 


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Neural Networks principles, colframe=pink, colback=pink!10!white,coltitle=black, breakable, fonttitle=\bfseries]
    A simple way to understand neural networks is to imagine a machine that can convert numbers into some other numbers. Since the machine has parameters, it is possible to adjust them until the numbers produced by the device match the expected ones. Mathematically speaking the machine will just perform series of matrix product and thresholding. This technology has its roots in the work of Gauss and Legendre on regression at the end of the XVIIIe century, long before the computer existed.
    Today, neural networks are ubiquitous and have evolved to accomplish various tasks from predicting prices, diagnosing diseases or even talking almost like a human.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Neural Networks for genomics}
Advancements in sequencing and high-throughput technologies (new generation sequencing) since the close of the previous century have resulted in a substantial increase in data collection within the field of genomics. Consequently, the field of computer science has emerged as a pivotal component of genomics research. Originally conceptualized in the 1960s, neural networks were limited in their practical applications due to computational constraints. The emergence of efficient hardware like \gls{gpu} has made it feasible to train deep neural networks by performing millions of calculations per second \cite{simard_gpu_2005}.
Neural network have proven its ability to decipher complex rules in genome regulation such as syntax of motif \cite{avsec_base-resolution_2021}. It can also serve as a sandbox to experiment synthetic sequence or mutation effects.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks for genomics}
The principle of \gls{cnn} is based on emulating the visual process occurring in animal brains, with the idea that object recognition arises from detecting and combining patterns at different scales \cite{hubel_receptive_1968, fukushima_neocognitron_1980}. This principle has been adapted to computation and is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cnn_graphabstract}. Starting from the detection of basic shapes through convolution, a \gls{cnn} progressively reduces the dimensionality of the input while preserving the most relevant features (via pooling). This process can be repeated multiple times at different scales (by varying convolution filter size and pooling operations), and the extracted features are finally combined through fully connected layers to recognize more sophisticated patterns at higher levels of abstraction. A significant advantage of the \gls{cnn} architecture is the strong reduction in receptive field size and input dimensionality before the final fully connected layer, which substantially decreases the computational cost compared to architectures relying solely on multiple fully connected layers.

Largely adopted for image recognition with the rise of standard datasets and a worldwide race for improved performance \cite{li_mnist_2012, krizhevsky_imagenet_2017}, \glspl{cnn} have also proven highly effective for studying the long sequences of letters that constitute \gls{dna}. These models learn to detect patterns at different scales, such as short \gls{dna} motifs, and to capture the syntax of these motifs. In doing so, \glspl{cnn} can uncover intricate relationships within DNA sequences, making them powerful tools in fields such as genomics and bioinformatics. The first deep-learning models for biological sequences demonstrate large improvement compared to traditionnal machine learning models for different tasks such as predicting \gls{dna}/\gls{rna}-protein binding\cite{alipanahi_predicting_2015}, annotating genomes \cite{zhou_predicting_2015, kelley_basset_2016} or predicting chromatin structure \cite{wang_review_2025}.

Several studies have also addressed nucleosome positioning using deep learning architectures trained directly on raw sequence \cite{di_gangi_deep_2018, amato_corenup_2020, zhou_deepnup_2022, han_nucleosome_2022}. These models, which range from \glspl{cnn} to more complex multi-layer networks, consistently achieve high predictive accuracy across species, confirming that nucleosome occupancy is strongly encoded in the DNA sequence itself. However, their contribution has remained mostly at the predictive level.

Efforts to interpret these models have been scarce and largely limited to descriptive analyses such as k-mer enrichment at favored nucleosome positions \cite{masoudi-sobhanzadeh_interpretable_2024, mondo_consecutive_2025}. Such approaches highlight biases like AA/TT/TA periodicity or GC-rich preferences, but provide little mechanistic insight into how these features integrate with transcription factor binding or repeat-derived elements to shape chromatin organization. Moreover, most previous works did not systematically test whether the patterns learned by the networks correspond to experimentally validated regulatory determinants.

A particularly compelling advance is the design of DNA sequences for \textit{in vivo} nucleosome positioning \cite{routhier_silico_2024}. The authors combined deep mutational scanning with kinetic Monte Carlo optimization to design synthetic yeast DNA sequences that, when assembled in tandem arrays, produced nucleosomal arrays with \gls{nrl} larger than the natural ~165 bp. Importantly, these arrays were validated \textit{in vivo}, demonstrating that computationally designed sequences can directly impose nucleosome phasing rules. This work illustrates the feasibility of functional chromatin design and identifies sequence rules with real consequences for nucleosome organization, at least in gene-dense genomes.

\subsubsection{Language Models for Genomics}
Inspired by advances in \gls{nlp}, recent years have seen the rise of transformer-based models in genomics. Originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) \cite{vaswani_attention_2023}, the transformer architecture relies entirely on attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies within sequential data. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which operate on fixed receptive fields, transformers can attend to all positions in a sequence simultaneously, enabling the modeling of complex, non-local interactions, a key feature of genomic regulation.

Genomic sequences, much like language, exhibit hierarchical and context-dependent patterns. This analogy has led to the development of language models for DNA, trained on large corpora of genomic sequences in a self-supervised manner. One of the earliest examples is DNABERT, which adapted the BERT architecture to k-mer tokenized DNA and demonstrated transfer learning capabilities across multiple genomic tasks \cite{ji_dnabert_2021}. More recently, large-scale pretraining efforts such as the Nucleotide Transformer \cite{dalla-torre_nucleotide_2023} have scaled up these models to hundreds of millions of parameters, trained on entire genomes across species.

In the context of nucleosome positioning, transformer-based models are still emerging but show great potential. A notable example is Borzoi, a nucleotide-resolution transformer pretrained on the human genome and fine-tuned to predict chromatin features such as nucleosome occupancy, DNA accessibility, and transcription factor binding \cite{zhou_borzoi_2024}. Borzoi achieves high predictive accuracy while offering interpretable attention maps, making it a promising tool for deciphering the latent regulatory code of chromatin.

Beyond prediction, language models also serve as exploratory tools: their attention weights and learned embeddings can reveal biologically meaningful patterns, such as sequence periodicity, motif co-occurrence, or genome compartmentalization. As these models continue to grow in size and resolution, they are expected to play an increasingly central role in sequence-to-function modeling in genomics.

Despite their impressive performance, transformer-based language models come with notable limitations: they are computationally expensive to train and deploy, often requiring specialized hardware and large datasets, and their complex internal representations make biological interpretation challenging.

\section{The determinants of nucleosome positioning}
\subsection{Sequence and chromatin: a dual influence}
In their seminal 1988 paper, Kornberg and Stryer proposed that the DNA sequence alone may not possess sufficient intrinsic affinity for stable histone association, suggesting instead that regular nucleosome positioning might arise from boundary effects within chromatin rather than from sequence-dictated placement \cite{kornberg_statistical_1988}. This early insight hinted at a more nuanced interplay between DNA and higher-order chromatin structure - an idea that would gain further traction as subsequent studies began to examine how both local sequence features and contextual cues shape nucleosome landscapes.

Early models of nucleosome positioning proposed that the DNA sequence alone encodes sufficient information to guide nucleosome placement. A landmark study by Segal et al. (2006) introduced the idea of a "genomic code" for nucleosome organization. They suggested that specific sequence motifs like $AA/TA$ dinucleotides (with a \string~10.5bp periodic enrichment) facilitate DNA bending and rotational positioning on the histone octamer. By combining \textit{in vitro} selection experiments with probabilistic modeling, Segal and colleagues showed that around 50\% of \textit{in vivo} nucleosome could be preticted from the sequence features \cite{segal_genomic_2006}.
However, this model was challenged and refined by Kaplan et al. (2009), who performed high-throughput \textit{in vitro} nucleosome reconstitution on entire yeast and human genomes. Their data confirmed that sequence preferences do drive nucleosome positioning \textit{in vitro}, and that models trained on such data can predict occupancy with high accuracy under controlled conditions. Yet, by comparing these \textit{in vitro} profiles to \textit{in vivo} nucleosome maps, Kaplan et al. demonstrated that many sequence-predicted nucleosomes are absent or displaced in living cells. This discrepancy highlighted the role of trans-acting factors, such as chromatin remodelers, transcription factors, and replication-associated processes, which can override or reprogram sequence-encoded preferences\cite{kaplanDNAencodedNucleosomeOrganization2009}.
Extending this analysis to human cells, Valouev et al. (2011) mapped nucleosome positioning \textit{in vivo} in multiple human cell types using MNase-seq and found that the influence of DNA sequence diminishes further in complex genomes. While certain DNA features (e.g., CpG content, poly(dA:dT) tracts) still contribute locally to nucleosome positioning, Valouev et al. showed that cell-type-specific chromatin landscapes dominate the observed patterns. Notably, they found a weak correlation between predicted \textit{in vitro} occupancy and actual \textit{in vivo} nucleosome maps in humans, emphasizing the dominant role of regulatory architecture, including transcriptional state, histone modifications, and boundary elements like CTCF \cite{valouev_determinants_2011}.
This view is further supported by studies of the Widom 601 sequence, which was selected for its exceptionally strong nucleosome positioning ability \textit{in vitro} \cite{lowary_new_1998} and has become a widely used model for nucleosome positioning studies. Despite its high affinity in biochemical assays \textit{in vitro}, integration of large tandem repeats of the 601 sequence into the yeast genome failed to reproduce the expected nucleosome positioning pattern. This result highlights how the chromatin environment in vivo can override even the strongest intrinsic sequence signals \cite{lancrey_nucleosome_2022}.

Together, these studies delineate a clear trajectory: from an early emphasis on intrinsic sequence-driven positioning toward a more nuanced view in which DNA sequence acts as a baseline framework, modulated or even overridden by cellular context and chromatin dynamics. The periodic dinucleotide patterns remain important for understanding nucleosome formation potential, but real genomic nucleosome organization reflects a complex interplay between sequence, chromatin remodelers, transcriptional activity, and higher-order genome architecture.
Rather than being mutually exclusive, these mechanisms likely cooperate. For instance, a DNA region may intrinsically favor nucleosome formation, but the presence of a transcription factor could displace the nucleosome, effectively acting as a barrier. This concept gave rise and confirmed the Kornberg's insight of a barrier model, in which a nucleosome-depleted region created by regulatory proteins establishes a boundary that organizes surrounding nucleosomes into a phased, periodic array \cite{mavrich_barrier_2008}. The most recurrent case of study is the \gls{tss}, which typically displays a \gls{nfr} followed by a well-positioned +1 nucleosome. This arrangement is highly conserved across eukaryotes and has been consistently observed in genome-wide maps of nucleosome occupancy \cite{mavrich_barrier_2008, schones_dynamic_2008, jiang_nucleosome_2009}. The \gls{nfr} acts as a strong barrier, largely maintained by the binding of general transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, which prevents nucleosome assembly directly at the promoter. The +1 nucleosome downstream of the NFR serves as a reference point, from which statistical positioning and phasing propagate into the gene body. Thus, transcription start sites exemplify how sequence context, DNA-binding proteins, and remodeling activities cooperate to establish barrier-dependent nucleosome arrays. It is, however, noteworthy that despite the presence of a similarly regular nucleosome array upstream of the \gls{tss}, chemical mapping data reveal nucleosome occupancy within promoters \cite{voong_genome-wide_2017}, in contrast to the \gls{nfr} typically described.
While transcription start sites illustrate barrier formation through the combined action of DNA sequence context, transcription factors, and remodelers, other sequence elements may also generate barriers intrinsically. For instance, sequence elements like microsatellites may contribute to barrier formation themselves. Repetitive motifs such as $GAA$ have been associated with nucleosome exclusion zones, as a repetitive element can affect locally the \gls{dna} stiffness \cite{zhao_gaa_2015}, suggesting that certain sequence patterns both attract and repel nucleosomes depending on context.

Summing up these findings, a plausible explanation for the genome-wide dispersion of nucleosome patches is that the genome itself is punctuated by sequence elements that recruit or act as chromatin barriers. These include transcription factor binding motifs, transcription start sites that attract RNA polymerase, and microsatellite regions that may intrinsically disrupt nucleosome formation. From this view, the determinants of nucleosome positioning are effectively encoded within the DNA sequence, not as direct placement instructions, but as proxies that influence the recruitment of regulatory machinery and the establishment of chromatin boundaries. 

\subsection{Chromatin remodelers are actively driving nucleosome position}

Chromatin remodelers are protein complexes that can shape chromatin. These enzymes are highly conserved in metazoans. Their control over nucleosomes is exerted both through histone post-translational modifications and nucleosome displacement. Their ATPase domain allows them to leverage sufficient energy to unwrap \gls{dna} from around the nucleosome, eject nucleosomes, or relocate them \cite{tyagi_chromatin_2016}. 

Although chromatin remodelers do not bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, Rippe et al. (2007) showed \textit{in vitro} that they can read DNA sequence features and position nucleosomes accordingly \cite{rippe_dna_2007}. Other \textit{in vivo} studies in yeast have shown that DNA sequence can indirectly influence the action of chromatin remodelers by serving as a binding platform for transcription factors that recruit them \cite{badis_library_2008,mcknight_sequence-targeted_2016}. 

Going further, by adding chromatin remodelers and a few \gls{tf}, Oberbeckmann and colleagues (2024) showed that chromatin domains formed \textit{in vitro} correlate with those observed \textit{in vivo}. Despite some differences (such as additional \gls{nfr}), nucleosome positioning also tends to be similar \cite{oberbeckmann_vitro_2024}. These remodelers are grouped into conserved families, each with distinct interaction partners and functional roles. Table~\ref{tab:remodelers} summarizes the main families, their partners, and associated functions. These factors are recognized determinants of nucleosome positioning, but since they are not completely independent of the DNA sequence, their effects on nucleosome positioning might still be captured from sequence alone.

\subsection{Pioneers factors engage nucleosome rearrangement}
Pioneer \gls{tf} are defined by their ability to bind closed chromatin and convert it to an open state. Upon engaging nucleosomal \gls{dna}, they recruit chromatin remodelers and/or non-pioneer \gls{tf}, promoting nucleosome eviction or repositioning and thereby increasing accessibility. Pioneer factors are key drivers of cell-fate programming because they activate enhancers and promoters that are initially embedded in facultative heterochromatin \cite{balsalobre_pioneer_2022}. In mouse, the pluripotency factors Sox2, Klf4, and Oct4 target silenced, nucleosome-enriched regions, recognize partially occluded \gls{tfbs} wrapped on nucleosomes, and remodel local chromatin architecture \cite{soufi_pioneer_2015, stadhouders_transcription_2018}. Similarly, NeuroD1 can trigger neuronal differentiation by binding epigenetically repressed neuronal genes \cite{pataskar_neurod1_2016}. In all cases, pioneer-factor binding reshapes chromatin topology and alters transcription by activating previously silent genes \cite{stadhouders_transcription_2018}.

\subsection{CTCF as a nucleosome positioning anchor}
Among the many factors influencing nucleosome positioning, the transcription factor CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) plays a particularly prominent role. Initially identified as an insulator protein \cite{rao_3d_2014}, CTCF is now recognized as a central architectural regulator of the genome, coordinating both chromatin looping and local chromatin accessibility. One of its most striking features is its ability to generate phased nucleosome arrays flanking its binding sites \cite{teif_genome-wide_2012, owens_ctcf_2019}. Unlike pioneer factors, which typically recruit remodeling complexes to rearrange nucleosomes, CTCF can directly bind to DNA even when it is wrapped around a nucleosome and independently induce nucleosome repositioning \cite{grand_genome_2024}. Moreover, CTCF has been shown to preserve the nucleosomal arrangement surrounding its sites throughout the cell cycle \cite{owens_ctcf_2019}.
CTCF-induced phasing is not a passive consequence of binding, but rather depends on an active interplay with cohesin and other chromatin-associated factors. The presence of additional transcription factor binding motifs nearby modulates the extent of nucleosome repositioning, showing that sequence context (both within and around the CTCF motif) acts as a combinatorial signal for local chromatin remodeling \cite{grand_genome_2024, do_binding_2025}. Furthermore, the directionality of the motif, driven by its asymmetry, plays a critical role in the downstream organization of nucleosomes and in the formation of chromatin loops. The asymmetry leads to polarized phasing, with stronger periodicity observed downstream of the motif, consistent with its orientation-dependent function in loop extrusion and domain insulation \cite{rao_3d_2014,nichols_ctcf_2015,guo_crispr_2015}. These findings support a model in which CTCF binding sites encode chromatin architecture through their sequence, not only by recruiting architectural proteins but also by directly imposing a nucleosomal landscape. Thus, CTCF exemplifies how DNA sequence alone can instruct precise and reproducible chromatin patterns.
Concerning CTCF, its motif is described as a triptych of an upper motif, a 15bp core motif and a downstream motif. While binding can occur efficiently through the core motif alone, primarily engaging \gls{zf} 3-7, the upstream and downstream segments-interacting with \gls{zf} 9-11 and 1 respectively contribute significantly to the overall binding stability and specificity \cite{yang_structures_2023}.
Recent work has shown that these submotifs are not equivalent in their contribution to binding affinity and chromatin organization. The core motif is essential for CTCF recognition and DNA binding, while the upstream and downstream flanking sequences modulate the strength, orientation, and functional output of the site. Do et al. demonstrated that variations within the flanking motifs can alter nucleosome phasing patterns, even when the core binding is maintained \cite{do_genome_2024}. This suggests that the extended CTCF motif functions as a modular signal, with different segments encoding different layers of regulatory information - from binding stability to chromatin remodeling potential. This intricate encoding highlights the dual nature of CTCF sites as both sequence-specific transcription factor binding sites and architectural nucleosome-positioning elements.

\section{Stakes and purposes of my study}
Upscaling the study done by Routhier et al. from yeast to mouse presents significant challenges. Yeast have compact genomes, with narrow intergenic regions and a dense organization of genes and regulatory elements, often arranged consecutively.  
In contrast, mammalian genomes are much larger, and genes account for only about 3\% of their total length. The key question, therefore, was whether neural networks could maintain their predictive power in such a sparse genomic landscape.

\gls{cnn} have to ability to capture and exctract information from huge, noisy signals. Previous studies provide insight of certain genomics features that locally position nucleosome on the genome \cite{di_gangi_deep_2018,amato_corenup_2020,zhou_deepnup_2022,han_nucleosome_2022}, achieving accurate predictions across species. Yet, little is known about the biological features these models can reveal. Most interpretability efforts have focused on k-mer enrichment at favored nucleosome positions~\cite{masoudi-sobhanzadeh_interpretable_2024,mondo_consecutive_2025}, providing limited insight into the regulatory logic encoded in the sequence. Using neural network aims to generate an exhaustive and comprehensive map of \gls{npr}. On top of that, it constitutes a sandbox to generate synthetic sequences or study the effect of \textit{in silico} mutated sequences.
Given the complex interplay between DNA sequence, chromatin folding, and genome regulation, we ask whether a neural network could achieve the \textit{tour de force} of reconstructing a meaningful portrait of regulatory logic from nucleosome positioning alone. \\
We hypothesize that \glspl{cnn}, when properly trained, can extract relevant regulatory signals even in challenging genomic contexts such as low-mappability regions, repetitive elements, or gene-sparse loci. Furthermore, we posit that once such models produce accurate and biologically consistent predictions, they can be leveraged to explore \textit{in silico} synthetic sequences. This opens the possibility to simulate and interrogate nucleosome behavior in controlled sequence contexts, offering a new framework for studying the sequence determinants of chromatin organization.

Given these considerations, our study addresses three main questions:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can nucleosome positioning be accurately predicted from DNA sequence alone in the large, gene-sparse genome of a mammal, as previously shown in the compact genome of yeast?
    \item If so, can the neural network be interpreted to reveal biologically relevant determinants of nucleosome positioning, beyond simple k-mer enrichment?
    \item What is the role of repetitive elements—known to carry regulatory potential—in shaping nucleosome organization, and can functional motifs embedded within them be detected by the model?
\end{enumerate}

To address these questions, the next chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of model performance, interpretability, and biological insight, leveraging both \gls{ism} and motif discovery. We aimed to go further than simple k-mer analysis by leveraging synthetic genomics to explore the impact of controlled sequence modifications, thereby testing specific hypotheses about the sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning.
 

\chapter{Neural networks can predict \textit{in vivo} nucleosome positioning}
\section{Nucleosome are positioned in island along the genome.}
To investigate nucleosome organization, assays such as MNase-seq and chemical cleavage aim to sequence the \gls{dna} fragments protected by histones. As these experiments are typically performed on a population of thousands to millions of cells (bulk experiment), the resulting signal reflects an average nucleosome occupancy landscape along the genome. Regions consistently occupied by nucleosomes across most cells appear as well-defined peaks. When nucleosomes are regularly spaced and aligned in phase across the population, a periodic pattern emerges in the signal: these are referred to as phased nucleosomes. In contrast, regions where nucleosome positions vary from cell to cell result in broader or attenuated signals, indicative of fuzzy nucleosomes whose positions are not strictly conserved as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fuzzy_nuc}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Results/fuzzy_nucleosomes.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Schematic representation of nucleosome fragment aggregation in bulk-cell data.} Created with biorender}
    \label{fig:fuzzy_nuc}
\end{figure}

In the same vein, arrays of regularly positioned nucleosomes won't clearly appear in the signal, depending whether or not these arrays are phased in most cells in the bulk. The resulting signal will vary from stochastic noise to a flat line with no defined nucleosomes as schematized in Figure~\ref{fig:phased_nuc}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Results/phased_nucleosomes.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Schematic representation of nucleosome phased and unphased arrays in bulk-cell data.} Created with biorender}
    \label{fig:phased_nuc}
\end{figure}

The implication of this retrieved average nucleosome landscape is that the determinants we can identify are necessarily those recurrent across the majority of cells in the bulk population. In contrast, biological processes such as transcription or replication often occur heterogeneously in an asynchronous bulk, meaning that cell-to-cell variability in nucleosome positioning linked to these processes is likely to be masked \cite{jiang_nucleosome_2009}.

Although the concept of \gls{nrl} remains debated at the single-cell level \cite{ricci_chromatin_2015}, bulk experiments allow estimating an average nucleosome spacing across the genome. To this end, we applied an autocorrelation analysis on a 10-kb sliding window to recover the distance between neighboring nucleosomes. While this approach differs from previous methods \cite{valouev_determinants_2011}, our estimates are consistent with other reports in mouse \cite{teif_genome-wide_2012}. We obtained an average \gls{nrl} of 187bp, corresponding to 147bp of wrapped \gls{dna} plus a 40bp linker region (Figure~\ref{fig:mnase_autocor}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Results/autocorr_wg_2sig.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Autocorrelation of experimental signals.} Both MNase-seq and chemical cleavage data exhibit a predominant periodic component of approximately 187~bp.}
\label{fig:mnase_autocor}
\end{figure}

The characteristic nucleosome pattern can be detected using a wavelet transform, which is designed to identify local frequencies in a signal (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:methods_of_interpretation}), in contrast to Fourrier transform that will completely loose the space resolution. When examining nucleosome positioning across the genome (Figure~\ref{fig:wavelet_sig}), we observe that nucleosomes are broadly distributed, but regularly phased arrays occur only in restricted regions. Using wavelet decomposition, we can detect periodic signals in the MNase-seq coverage at multiple scales, which allows us to distinguish between background nucleosome occupancy and genuine phased domains. We refer to these regions of strong periodicity as \emph{nucleosome islands}, reflecting local patches of ordered arrays embedded within a largely irregular nucleosome landscape.


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Results/wavelet_sig.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Representative MNase-seq signal and its wavelet transform at different scales.} Wavelet peaks coincide with well-positioned nucleosome arrays.}
\label{fig:wavelet_sig}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
Figure~\ref{fig:wavelet_size} shows the distribution of nucleosome island sizes, as estimated from the width of the wavelet transform peaks. Genome-wide, nucleosome islands contain up to 15~phased-nucleosomes, with an average of about 5~nucleosomes per array (based on MNase-seq data). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Results/wavelet_size.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Histogram of wavelet peak widths.} The mean size around 1~kb corresponds to an array of approximately 5 phased nucleosomes.}
\label{fig:wavelet_size}
\end{figure}

These results suggest that nucleosomes are organized in well-phased arrays, but only around specific genomic hot-spots. The genome would be therefore punctuated by sequence elements that strongly position nucleosomes in their vicinity. 

We asked whether a \gls{cnn}, given only the DNA sequence, could learn the determinants underlying both the genome-wide nucleosome landscape and the phased arrays that emerge locally. If successful, such a model would not only capture the basal rules of nucleosome positioning but also highlight strong sequence features acting as focal points for chromatin organization.

\section{Overall performances}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=What is a good prediction?, colframe=pink, colback=pink!10!white,coltitle=black, breakable, fonttitle=\bfseries]

Assessing the performance of a machine learning model in biology is not straightforward. Most experimental data suffer from biases or limitations, either due to the technology used or the intrinsic variability of biological systems. As such, a prediction that perfectly fits experimental data may simply replicate those limitations.

Moreover, multiple criteria can be considered when comparing biological signals. In the case of nucleosomes, the most relevant aspect is the predicted position of nucleosomes. Pearson correlation is often used to assess the similarity in shape between two signals, allowing for the comparison of predicted and experimental occupancy patterns-focusing on relative positioning, rather than the absolute values of the signal.

Beyond purely quantitative agreement, a truly meaningful prediction must also capture biologically relevant features. In other words, it should not only fit the data; it should make sense in light of established biological knowledge. For example, one of our model trained on Hi-C data (not shown here) achieved excellent global correlation and signal similarity, yet completely ignored charachteristic nucleosome phasing around CTCF binding sites or \gls{tss}, which are well-known nucleosome organizers. Such a model, despite its metrics, fails to capture an essential aspect of chromatin structure.
\end{tcolorbox}
\vspace{1em}

To assess the performance of our network, we computed the Pearson correlation between the experimental and predicted nucleosome positioning profiles. Chromosome 19, which was excluded from the training and validation process, served as the test set, ensuring that the \gls{nn} had not encountered any of its sequences during learning. The resulting correlations are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:corr_triu_matrix}.

As expected, the two MNase-seq mapping strategies (Box~\ref{box:mappability}) yield very similar predictions. Our \gls{cnn} models exhibit strong predictive performance, achieving Pearson correlations of 0.75 and 0.65 for chemical cleavage and MNase-seq data, respectively. Surprisingly, the predicted profiles are more strongly correlated with each other than the corresponding experimental datasets, suggesting that the two experimental signals may share a common underlying informational structure captured by the model.

\end{figure} 


Our model uses an input sequence of 2,001 base pairs (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:architecture}), which defines the maximum span of information it can exploit to predict nucleosome occupancy. Despite this local window constraint, the model achieves excellent predictive performance, with Pearson correlations reaching up to 0.75 on held-out chromosomes. This demonstrates that a substantial portion of nucleosome positioning signals is encoded in the immediate sequence context.
Nevertheless, such a finite receptive field inherently limits the model’s ability to integrate broader genomic cues, such as distal regulatory elements, long-range chromatin interactions, or positioning signals emerging from higher-order nucleosome phasing. These long-range dependencies may be critical in specific contexts, particularly around insulators, enhancers, or within \glspl{tad}.
Future efforts could address this by incorporating architectures capable of capturing extended dependencies, such as dilated convolutions, recurrent layers, or transformer-based models. This would allow the model to account for both local sequence determinants and global chromatin context, potentially leading to even more biologically faithful predictions.

In addition to achieving high predictive performance, our model captures fine-grained biological features of nucleosome organization, which can be visualized through aggregated nucleosome occupancy profiles centered on CTCF binding sites (Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_aggregate}). These plots, based on predictions from held-out test regions, display the canonical phased nucleosome arrays flanking CTCF. Strikingly, the model recapitulates this pattern for both MNase-seq and chemical cleavage datasets, even though no CTCF annotation was used during training. This suggests that the model has learned to recognize intrinsic sequence features that encode chromatin architecture around such regulatory elements.
Furthermore, our predicted profiles mirror subtle experimental differences between the two datasets. In particular, predictions trained on the chemical cleavage signal exhibit a central dip in nucleosome occupancy, corresponding to the so-called fragile nucleosome directly over the CTCF motif. This feature, well described by Voong et al. (2017), is underrepresented or absent in MNase-seq data due to the MNase enzyme’s preferential digestion of loosely bound or partially unwrapped nucleosomes \cite{voong_genome-wide_2017}. Its presence in the chemical cleavage-based predictions and absence in the MNase-based ones demonstrates that the model has internalized not just the sequence rules, but also the technical biases and sensitivities of the input data.
This ability to reproduce both shared and method-specific chromatin features further supports the biological and experimental interpretability of the model’s predictions. It also validates the idea that deep learning can serve as a proxy for chromatin profiling, while enabling new in silico experiments.
Building on these results, we next asked whether the model could generalize to more challenging regions of the genome; in particular, those typically excluded from experimental analyses due to low mappability.

\section{Trained model accurately predicts the nucleosome density over non-mappable regions.}

As we used the uniquely-mapped signal (see Box~\ref{box:mappability}) to train MNase-seq model, we excluded repeated elements that are were sufficiently covered (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:architecture}). At the genome-wide scale, the MNase-seq model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.65 with the experimental data. To assess the model's performance in poorly mappable regions, we compared its predictions to the alternative multi-mapped signal: we selected genomic segments with length between 50 and 1000bp, with a mappability strictly lower than 1. Regions showing high agreement between the uniquely-mapped and multi-mapped signals were discarded, yielding approximately 200{,}000 regions for analysis.

Figure~\ref{fig:corr_poorly_mappable} shows the correlation between the model's predictions and both types of mapping strategies. We observe that, in these low-mappability regions, around 60\% of the correlations are higher with multi-mapped signal, suggesting that the model trained on uniquely-mapped regions is able to generalize from its training on mappable regions and infer the nucleosome occupancy on the poorly covered regions.
%the multi-mapping strategy is a good proxy regarding the nucleosome occupancy on the repeated element  that is otherwise lost when only uniquely mapped reads are considered.\\

\end{figure}

To illustrate this, Figure~\ref{fig:poorly_mappable_extract} shows an example of a poorly mappable region. While the uniquely mapped signal is extremely sparse, the multi-mapped signal reveals a clear nucleosomal pattern. The model prediction aligns with the multi-mapped signal, demonstrating that the network captures meaningful features even in regions traditionally considered unreliable.

\section{Internal validation and relation to previous work}
Direct comparison with other nucleosome positioning models was not performed here for two main reasons.  
First, most existing approaches are classification-based (linker vs nucleosome) or tailored to \textit{in vitro} short-reads datasets, whereas our task involves predicting continuous occupancy profiles \textit{in vivo} from sequence alone.  
Second, although our methodology closely follows the interpretable deep learning framework introduced by Routhier \textit{et al.} for the compact yeast genome, the substantial genomic differences between yeast and mouse (particularly in genome size, repeat content, and mappability) mean that a direct benchmark is not strictly equivalent.  

Nevertheless, a qualitative comparison with Routhier’s results is informative. In their study, correlations between predicted and experimental nucleosome profiles reached 0.68 on the yeast genome\cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}, which is gene-dense and largely well-mappable.  
In our case, we obtain correlations up to 0.75 (chemical cleavage) and 0.65 (MNase-seq) on the much larger and more repetitive mouse genome, where a substantial fraction of nucleosomes lie in regions of low mappability.  
Achieving performance in this range, despite the greater genomic complexity, suggests that the model retains predictive power in the face of genomic complexity. The robustness of our model can be evaluated internally through several complementary lines of evidence.

Further internal validation comes from multiple complementary lines of evidence.
First, high correlations obtained on a completely held-out chromosome (19) indicate that the network generalizes beyond sequences seen during training. Second, the convergence of predictions between MNase-seq and chemical cleavage data, while still reflecting their specific differences (for example, the presence or absence of the fragile nucleosome at the center of CTCF sites), suggests that the network captures genuine biological determinants while also incorporating the technical biases specific to each method. Finally, the ability to predict relevant profiles in low-mappability regions—where experimental signal is notoriously degraded—supports the use of the model as a tool for “completion” or exploration of genomic regions traditionally ignored.

Altogether, these observations confirm that the information contained within the local 2kbp sequence context is sufficient to reconstruct biologically interpretable nucleosome positioning signals, paving the way for a systematic analysis of \glspl{npr} discussed in the following chapter.

\chapter{Opening the black box: \textit{In Silico Mutagenesis} extracts nucleosome positioning rules}

The previous section established that our convolutional neural network achieves accurate predictions of nucleosome positioning from DNA sequence alone, even under challenging conditions such as low-mappability regions. We now turn to the question of \textit{why the model makes these predictions and specifically, which sequence features it relies upon ?}.

Neural networks are often criticized for their “black box” nature: while inputs and outputs are accessible, the internal mechanisms driving predictions remain largely opaque. Several strategies have been developed to address this limitation, broadly divided into two families: perturbation-based methods and gradient-based methods.

Gradient-based approaches, such as saliency maps, Integrated Gradients, or DeepLIFT, estimate the importance of each input feature by computing the gradient of the output with respect to the input. They are computationally efficient but rely on backpropagated signals through a highly non-linear model, which can make them less intuitive to interpret in a biological context.
Perturbation-based approaches, by contrast, systematically modify parts of the input—such as masking or mutating specific bases—and observe how the output changes. This makes them model-agnostic and conceptually straightforward, at the cost of higher computational demands. 

In this work, we adopt \gls{ism} a perturbation-based approach in which each nucleotide in a sequence is mutated in turn, and the resulting change in the model’s prediction is recorded.  The principle of this method illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_mut} is to measure the difference in prediction when a mutation occurs in any sequence: the network prediction will noticeably change only if the locus where the mutation occurred matter for the neural network to accurately predict the nucleosome positioning in its vicinity.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Results/graphic_mutasome.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Graphical abstract of In Silico Mutagenesis}. Sequences are muted in silico in order to observe change in the CNN prediction}
    \label{fig:graph_mut}
\end{figure}

\gls{ism} directly links the importance of each base to an observable change in prediction, making it easier to relate the network’s behaviour to underlying sequence features. Although more computationally demanding than gradient-based alternatives, its conceptual simplicity and minimal assumptions make it well suited to our goal: extracting biologically interpretable rules of nucleosome positioning from the model.

To illustrate the output of \gls{ism} in a genomic context, we selected a representative locus displaying phased nucleosome arrays. 
Figure~\ref{fig:focus_genomebrowser} shows, for both MNase-seq and chemical cleavage models, the experimental signal, the corresponding model predictions, and the \gls{ism} score track.\gls{ism} yields a generally flat signal, punctuated by sharp peaks that cluster in small genomic regions.
In this example, ISM high-scoring regions align with phased nucleosomes in the experimental data, highlighting that the model’s attributions coincide with well-established chromatin organization patterns.
For completeness, we also computed a saliency map track for the same locus, which yields a qualitatively similar pattern to ISM. Although we do not analyse saliency maps further in this work, their concordance with ISM supports the robustness of the attribution signal.

    \label{fig:focus_genomebrowser}
\end{figure}

To assess robustness of the method, we compared ISM profiles from the two independently trained networks (MNase-seq vs. chemical cleavage). Although the raw experimental signals are only moderately correlated (Figure~\ref{fig:corr_triu_matrix}, their ISM profiles show high agreement (correlation of 0.51), indicating that both networks share similar sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning (Figure~\ref{fig:corr_muts}).\\

    \label{fig:corr_muts}
\end{figure}

We further validated \gls{ism} against orthogonal data: DNase-seq and ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility assays) and a wavelet-based computational analysis. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omics_meta}, \gls{ism} peaks show strong concordance with these orthogonal measures of chromatin structure. Differences reflect assay properties: wavelets produce broader regions; DNase-seq highlights the most accessible sites (often the highest \gls{ism} peaks); ATAC-seq displays wider signal around the \gls{ism} peaks. \Gls{ism} consistently pinpoints compact, high-specificity sites with minimal noise.\\

    \label{fig:omics_meta}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
Zooming in on a single locus illustrates the resolution advantage of ISM: it highlights sequence determinants on the scale of \gls{tfbs} (around 20bp), whereas other signals extend over hundreds to thousands of base pairs (Figure~\ref{fig:omics_uniq}).

    \label{fig:omics_uniq}
\end{figure}


Together, these results indicate that ISM flags \textit{bona fide} biological determinants of nucleosome organization rather than assay-specific artifacts. We next examine the sequence content of these Nucleosome Positioning Regions (\gls{npr}) and the classes of elements that drive them.

\FloatBarrier
\section{In silico Mutagenesis highlights Nucleosome Positioning Regions}
Having established that \gls{ism} highlights compact, biologically relevant regions (Nucleosome Positioning Regions) that correlates with nucleosome islands, we next examined whether these regions are enriched for motifs that could point to sequence-specific factors that directly or indirectly shape nucleosome organization. The methodology used to call \glspl{npr} is described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methods_of_interpretation} and yielded a total of 613,545 regions of 20bp, which were concordant between MNase-seq and chemical cleavage \gls{ism} signals.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Results/cumulative_nprs_distance.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Cumulative distribution of \gls{npr} distances.} 
    About 9.4\% of intervals are below 20~bp, reflecting overlapping extracted sequences of \gls{npr}. Distances between 500~bp and 10~kb account for the majority of cases, while very large gaps (>10~kb) are rare, leading to the plateau.}
    \label{fig:nprs_distance}
\end{figure}

Their distribution along the genome is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nprs_distance}. The average distance is 3,916~bp, which does not differ from the expected average distance obtained by an equidistant positioning of the same number of \glspl{npr} genome-wide. However, the cumulative distribution of inter-\gls{npr} distances reveals distinct regimes. 
First, $\sim$9.4\% of intervals fall below 20bp, reflecting overlapping sequences introduced by the procedure. Second, only a small fraction of distances occur between 20 and 500~bp, as indicated by the shallow slope of the curve, suggesting that closely spaced \glspl{npr} are relatively rare. Third, the majority of distances accumulate between 500~bp and 10kb, where the curve rises steeply, defining the typical range of inter-\gls{npr} spacing. 
Beyond 10kb, the distribution reaches a plateau, indicating that very large gaps between \glspl{npr} are infrequent and likely correspond to extended regions depleted of positioned nucleosomes.

    Subsequent panels display experimental and predicted nucleosome occupancy profiles from MNase-seq and chemical cleavage assays, followed by the number of nucleosome positioning regions (NPRs) and RNA-seq coverage.}
    \label{fig:micro-c}
\end{figure}


To further investigate the dispersion of \glspl{npr}, we projected experimental and predicted nucleosome occupancy signals onto compartments defined from Micro-C data. Compartments were called using the first principal component of a normalized contact matrix \cite{cournac_normalization_2012}, which partitions the genome into two chromatin states. The orientation of PC1 was subsequently assigned by correlation with transcriptional activity, defining A- and B-like compartments (Figure~\ref{fig:micro-c}): RNA-seq coverage clearly distinguishes active regions consistent with A compartment, from transcriptionally silent regions consistent with the B compartments. 
Experimental nucleosome occupancy profiles show distinct behaviors: MNase-seq exhibits strong differences in average signal between compartments with much lower value in the B compartment, whereas the chemical cleavage signal is more uniform but tends to be higher in B compartments, suggesting opposite biases between the two assays. Predicted signals correlate with their respective experimental data but display smoother profiles across compartments. Finally, NPRs are detected genome-wide with pronounced local enrichments and moderate increase in average value in A compartments.

At the level of higher-order chromatin, it is noteworthy that both prediction models show little global variation between compartments, resembling the experimental signal obtained by chemical cleavage. Nevertheless, \glspl{npr} are not homogeneously distributed across the genome: although present in both compartments, they are enriched in A, the transcriptionally active compartment. 
%This suggests that the model captures sequence features that preferentially contribute to nucleosome organization in transcriptionally active domains.

To further investigate the link with transcription, we assessed model predictions around \gls{tss} selected for their nucleosome-positioning effect (see Methods and references). As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tss_nucpos_chr19}, our models correctly capture the presence of a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR). However, they fail to reproduce the precise positioning of the +1 nucleosome and the phased downstream arrays observed experimentally, despite the increased ISM signal at \gls{tss}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/TSS_meta.pdf}

    Bottom panels: heatmaps showing the observed nucleosome occupancy and ISM across individual loci, aligned on the TSS (dashed line).}
    \label{fig:tss_nucpos_chr19}
\end{figure}

These results show that \glspl{npr} punctuate the genome in a non-random manner and point to a connection with transcriptional activity. However, the precise contribution of sequence features remains unclear, motivating a closer examination of the sequence content of these regions to identify potential transcription factor binding motifs.

\section{Transcription factors binding sites motifs}
To focus on motifs with potential functional relevance in our system, we retained only those corresponding to transcription factors expressed above 1 transcript per million (TPM) in mouse embryonic stem cells, according to ENCODE RNA-seq data .

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/recap_xstreme.pdf}

    \label{fig:recap_xstreme}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:recap_xstreme} shows the top 20 motif found from JASPAR database and \textit{de novo} with STREME (s. De novo motif discovery (STREME) revealed enriched sequence patterns specific to our dataset, some of which deviate from canonical motifs. When comparing these results to known transcription factor binding sites from JASPAR using XSTREME, we observed partial overlap but also notable differences. This discrepancy can be explained by the different aims of the two approaches: de novo algorithms identify the most enriched signals in the sequences at hand, potentially uncovering context-specific or degenerate variants, whereas database scanning relies on predefined consensus motifs that represent averaged binding profiles across diverse conditions. Thus, the combination of both approaches provides complementary insights, highlighting both the canonical binding determinants and the dataset-specific variants that may drive nucleosome organization in mESC.

JASPAR provides matrix clusters, which group transcription factor binding motifs based on similarity. This hierarchical clustering uses correlation between position weight matrices to align and organize motifs, and each cluster is annotated with the corresponding structural class of the transcription factor. Such clustering simplifies the exploration of large motif collections by reducing redundancy and highlighting families of related motifs. In contrast, clusters produced by STREME (or other de novo approaches) arise directly from the enrichment of sequence patterns in the input data, and therefore reflect dataset-specific overrepresented motifs. JASPAR clusters represent a curated, knowledge-driven organization of known motifs, whereas STREME clusters represent an unsupervised, data-driven discovery of enriched patterns. Together, they provide complementary perspectives: JASPAR clusters offer a biological framework for interpretation, while de novo clusters capture the motifs most relevant in the studied context \cite{jaspar_matrix_clusters, rauluseviciute_jaspar_2024}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/common_xstreme_motif_scatterplot.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Number of sites retrieved from XSTREME motif discovery} The scatter plots shows the number of motifs from JASPAR (y-axis) and \textit{de novo} (x-axis) discovered.}
    \label{fig:common_scat_xstreme}
\end{figure}

Among the XSTREME motif discovery, ten motifs are retrieved in both approach (clustered together by XSTREME) and clustered in seven hierarchical clusters according to JASPAR (Figure~\ref{fig:common_scat_xstreme}). The JASPAR cluster~11 is composed of representative of the KLF/SP \gls{tfbs} familly and appear four times in this selection.

Among the motifs enriched in NPRs, CTCF stands out as the single most frequent and biologically interpretable hit. Given its well-established role in chromatin architecture and nucleosome phasing, we examined in detail how the model captures and responds to CTCF binding sites.

\subsection{CTCF as the conductor of nucleosome positioning}
the largest fraction of intersecting \gls{npr} carry CTCF binding cite. To better understand the sequence features driving the model’s predictions at CTCF sites, we compared the in silico mutagenesis (ISM) scores to the information content of the CTCF motif (Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_information}). The information content of each position in the \gls{pwm} reflects the sequence specificity of CTCF binding, with higher values indicating more conserved and functionally constrained bases.

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_information}, we show the CTCF consensus motif (as discovered in our data) alongside the average ISM score at each base within the motif. Strikingly, the ISM signal peaks over the same positions that exhibit high information content, particularly in the central core region known to engage zinc fingers 4 to 8. This alignment suggests that the model has learned to associate these conserved bases with their functional impact on nucleosome positioning.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/CTCF information.pdf}
    \caption{ISM score correlates with \gls{pwm} information on CTCF core binding site. Discovered CTCF motif and ISM score (left panel), Scatter plot of the information (y-axis) and the ISM score (x-axis) (right panel)}

    \label{fig:ctcf_information}
\end{figure}

The right panel confirms this relationship quantitatively: a positive correlation is observed between ISM scores and \gls{pwm} information content across motif positions. This indicates that the model is not only sensitive to the presence of the motif but also to its internal structure and variability, further supporting the biological interpretability of the network’s learned features.


\subsection{Among the large amout of CTCF sites, network can discriminate the positioning ones}
While CTCF motifs are widespread across the genome, only a subset are bound in vivo and associated with phased nucleosome arrays. To test whether the model distinguishes between functional and inert motif instances, we stratified CTCF sites by ChIP-seq binding status \cite{festuccia_transcription_2019} and examined predicted nucleosome landscapes around each group.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/chr19_CTCF_MNASECHEM_sites_heatmap_metaplot.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Nucleosome occupancy and ISM around CTCF sites}.}

    \label{fig:nuc_on_ctcf_site}
\end{figure}

Remarkably, Figure~\ref{fig:nuc_on_ctcf_site} shows that the model recovers the phased nucleosome arrays specifically around bound CTCF sites, while unbound motifs lack such structure in the predictions. The figure shows CTCF sites on chromosome 19 as they haven't took part of the training. This result confirms that the model captures subtle sequence determinants and local context features associated with functional CTCF occupancy, highlighting its ability to generalize beyond average profiles and to discriminate biologically relevant binding events.

To further confirm that the model has internalized sequence features specifically associated with CTCF-mediated nucleosome organization, we computed the average ISM signal on CTCF sites, stratified by binding status.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/Results/chr19_mnase_cmut_mutasome_on_ctcf_site_with_stats.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Average ISM signal on CTCF sites} Significativity computed using Mann-Withney test ($p<=1e-4$)}

    \label{fig:mut_on_ctcf_site}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mut_on_ctcf_site}, bound CTCF sites exhibit significantly higher ISM scores compared to unbound sites, for both the MNase-seq and chemical cleavage-trained models. This strong signal suggests that the model has learned to associate specific sequence features (such as the CTCF motif and its surrounding context) with nucleosome positioning activity. In contrast, unbound motif instances elicit little to no ISM response, indicating a lack of influence on the predicted nucleosome occupancy. These findings provide further support for the model's capacity to distinguish regulatory from inert motif instances purely based on sequence, and to assign functional relevance through its internal representation. Interestingly, several sites classified as unbound by ChIP-seq still display phased arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes. These sites correspond to those with the highest \gls{ism} scores among the unbound set. They also show poorly mappable nucleosome occupancy, which may explain why they appear as false negatives.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{SP/KLF family position nucleosomes}
From all the motifs matching with the JASPAR-11 cluster (KLF/SP),  identified in our analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:common_scat_xstreme}), STREME-2 motif [GCCCCGCCC] most closely matches the JASPAR motif for KLF7 (Fig.~\ref{fig:klf_motif}). However, members of the KLF/SP transcription factor family share highly similar G-box motif, making unambiguous assignment to a single factor difficult from sequence alone. Given this similarity, functional insights from well-characterized family members can inform interpretation. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 1cm, clip, width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/KLF7_thesis.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Logoplot of the \textit{de novo} retrieved STREME-2 motif and its best match (KLF7) in the JASPAR database.}}
    \label{fig:klf_motif}
\end{figure}

The chromatin landscapcape around this motif is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme_2} where nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) flanked by regularly phased nucleosomes is displayed with MNase-seq data, whereas the chemical-cleavage data show a phased-nucleosome array but no central depletion. This effect can be observed in both unique and repeated sequences, except for the LINE family. It is also noteworthy that experimental data and model predictions display similar nucleosome occupancy. Notably, some loci lack experimental coverage yet still yield predictions. The motif is mostly retrieved in unique genomic sequences ($\sim$65\%) and in LTR elements ($\sim$20\%). STREME-2 is not the only motif attributable to the SP/KLF \gls{tfbs} family, and further representatives will be discussed in a following section.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering

    \caption{\textbf{Predicted nucleosome occupancy and genomic distribution of the STREME-2 motif from the xstreme analysis.}}
    \label{fig:xstreme_2}
\end{figure}

Together, these findings underscore the role of SP/KLF-like motifs as important sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning. The consistent association of the G-box with phased nucleosomal arrays, and its enrichment in both unique genomic regions and LTR elements, suggest that members of the SP/KLF family contribute broadly to chromatin organization in mouse embryonic stem cells.

\subsection{Pluripotency factors are retrieved in Nucleosome Positioning Regions}

THAP11 (Ronin) has been identified as an essential factor for embryogenesis and the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells\cite{dejosez_ronin_2008}. Retrieved both \textit{de novo} ($E=6.81e-208$) and from JASPAR database($E=2.36e-1314$), it is surprisingly only retrieved in B2\_MM1 \gls{sine} subfamily. This motif is associated with \gls{npr} and phased-array of nucleosome in MNase-seq data, Chemical-cleavage data display really similar profile with a putative fragile-nucleosome (Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme_3}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/xstreme_onrep_meta_hm/3-CTGGGATTTGAACTC_withexp.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Predicted nucleosome occupancy and genomic distribution of the STREME-3 motif from the xstreme analysis.}}
    \label{fig:xstreme_3}
\end{figure}

Several several other \gls{tfbs} with established roles in mouse embryonic stem cell regulation were recovered in the JASPAR-based search. YY1 ($E=6.03e-1921$), an architectural protein with sequence-specific DNA binding activity, has been implicated in promoter–enhancer looping, nucleosome organization at regulatory elements and chromatin remodeler partner\cite{tyagi_chromatin_2016}. Nanog ($E=1.47e-66$),Oct4 ($E=1.96e-150$), Sox family ($E\in[5.63e-169, 4.84e-0.17]$) and Oct4::SOX2 heterodimer ($E=1.268e-112$) core pluripotency factors, are known for shaping the chromatin landscape of ESCs\cite{festuccia_transcription_2019}.

Although these motifs were not recovered \textit{de novo} in our STREME analysis, their enrichment in \glspl{npr} is consistent with their established roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility in stem cell chromatin. These additional factors, together with the strong signals from CTCF and SP/KLF, reinforce the view that \glspl{npr} identified by ISM correspond to sequence-encoded regulatory hotspots in the \gls{mesc} genome. The complete list of discovered \gls{tfbs} and E-values can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:xstreme_list}.

Looking at the retrieved \textit{de novo} motifs shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recap_xstreme}, an interesting fact is that beyond canonical regulatory sites such as CTCF or KLFs, the \gls{pwm} gives a single nucleotide per position, indicating high-conservation in the motif and most likely a repetitive origin. This observation suggests that transposable elements and other genomic repeats may act as reservoirs for nucleosome-positioning motifs. In summary, \gls{ism} reveals that the neural network relies on compact, interpretable, and biologically meaningful sequence features to predict nucleosome positioning. These features correspond not only to known transcription factor binding sites like CTCF and SP/KLF, but also to \textit{de novo} motifs enriched in repeats, hinting at a broader role for repetitive elements in chromatin organization. The next chapter will explore this connection in depth.

\chapter{From repeats to regulation: the repeated genome’s role in nucleosome organization}

\section{Transposable elements are actively involved in nucleosome positioning}
Figure~\ref{fig:volcano_npr_repClass} shows the enrichment of RepeatMasker subfamilies in \glspl{npr}, the detailled method of computation can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methods_of_interpretation}. Among the different \textit{repClass} categories, \gls{sine}, \gls{line}, \gls{ltr}, and satellite-related sequences (including \textit{low\_complexity} and \textit{Simple\_repeat}) stand out due to their strong association with \glspl{npr}. In particular, the B2~\gls{sine} family, which is already one of the most abundant classes of repeats in the mouse genome, shows a marked enrichment, suggesting that these elements are not only passively incorporated into the chromatin landscape but actively contribute to the establishment of phased nucleosome arrays. Similarly, LINE-1 (L1Md) and \gls{ltr} elements also display significant associations, consistent with their potential to provide sequence features and potential genomic regulation that strongly position nucleosomes\cite{pelinski_nf-b_2022,bakoulis_endogenous_2022}. Altogether, this analysis indicates that repetitive elements, beyond their role in genome expansion, serve as key sequence determinants that punctuate the genome with hotspots of nucleosome positioning.

\end{figure}

To better understand their specific contribution to chromatin organization, we next examined in greater detail the main repeat families enriched in nucleosome positioning regions, namely \glspl{sine}, \glspl{line}, \glspl{ltr}, and microsatellites elements.

\subsection{B2 SINEs as carriers of functional CTCF sites}

As discussed in the introduction, \glspl{sine}, and in particular the B2 family (comprising B3A, B2\_Mm2, B2\_Mm1t, B3, B2\_Mm1a), are known to harbor CTCF binding sites. Such insertions can introduce functional insulator elements that shape local chromatin structure and nucleosome organization \cite{schmidt_waves_2012}. Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_nprs_on_genome} shows that a substantial fraction ($\sim$80\%) of positioning CTCF motifs is embedded within B2-family SINE repeats.

    \label{fig:ctcf_nprs_on_genome}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, the strongest nucleosome-positioning CTCF sites are found in unique sequences, this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_amplitude_byrepname} that depicts the mean amplitude of the signal for each cluster, both model agree on a higher amplitude of B3s over B2s and the maximum is reach over unique sequences. The effect is visible on the heatmaps in Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_nprs_on_genome}.

\FloatBarrier
When comparing B3 and B2\_Mm2, it is clear that B3 elements carry a supplementary motif (STREME-13) absent in B2\_Mm2 repeat (Figure~\ref{fig:SINE_subfamilies}).
This observation is further confirmed by Figure~\ref{fig:Umotif_on_genome} which show that motif-13 is found in B3, B3A and unique sequences. This motif match with Ddit3::Cebpa ($E=4.9e-1$) motif in JASPAR database, however considering its location in the genome and its strong similarity with the the well-described upstream CTCF U-motif \cite{schmidt_waves_2012, soochit_ctcf_2021, do_binding_2025} we can reasonnably considering the motif 13 as such.

\end{figure}

Our model recapitulates this property: \gls{sine} elements overlapping conserved CTCF motifs exhibit clear nucleosome phasing patterns, consistent with the regulatory activity of their embedded CTCF sites. Phasing was even stronger for full CTCF motifs (upstream motif + core motif). This result highlights the model’s ability to distinguish functional motif instances even within repetitive contexts, demonstrates the high resolution of the ISM approach, and confirms its capacity to predict nucleosome positioning in line with known biology.

\subsection{Long Terminal Repeats}
Beyond their classification as transposable elements, many \gls{ltr} sequences originate from Endogenous RetroViruses (\glspl{erv}), ancient viral insertions that became fixed in the genome over evolutionary time. A typical \gls{erv} includes coding regions flanked by two \glspl{ltr}, which harbor regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. Even in the absence of intact viral genes, these \glspl{ltr} often persist as so-called solo \glspl{ltr} and retain their regulatory potential. This is particularly relevant in embryonic stem cells, where \gls{erv}-derived \glspl{ltr} can function as divergently transcribed regulatory elements, actively shaping the chromatin landscape. These sequences are frequently co-opted to drive transcription and contribute to enhancer activity \cite{bakoulis_endogenous_2022}. The observed enrichment of \gls{npr} on \glspl{ltr} in our study (Figure~\ref{fig:volcano_npr_repClass}) may therefore reflect the structural and regulatory influence of \gls{erv}-derived elements on nucleosome positioning. MT2\_MM is a representative solo \gls{ltr} element of this type \cite{Bao2020_MT2_MM}. Figure~\ref{fig:mt2_mm} shows that several motifs are consistently identified as \glspl{npr} on this repeat. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim=3.2cm 0cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, clip,width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/xstreme_onrep_seq/MT2_Mm.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{MT2\_Mm carries \glspl{npr}}}
    \label{fig:mt2_mm}
\end{figure}

The two main motifs (STREME 47 and 40) retrieved on MT2\_Mm are also found on other repetitive and unique sequences. Interestingly, for both motifs, predictions indicate only a \gls{npr} on MT2\_Mm sequences, whereas in unique sequences they predict regular and phased nucleosome positioning (Figure~\ref{fig:main_motif_mt2mm}). Both motifs exhibit very high information content, meaning they are highly consistent in nucleotide composition. Motif 47 (Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme47_ltr}) significantly ($E=2.2e-01$) matches the Dux (Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme47_ltr}) \gls{tfbs}. Dux is a recognized driver of totipotency in \gls{mesc} \cite{ren_dux_2022}. Motif 40 (Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme40_ltr}) has no match in the JASPAR database (Appendix~\ref{appendix:xstreme_list}).

Motif 15 significantly matches KLF9 ($E=3.35e-02$), a transcription factor of the KLF/SP family discussed earlier. In addition to MT2\_Mm, it is mostly found in ORR families, another \gls{ltr}-derived group. This motif also occurs in several \gls{line} sequences and in unique sequences. Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme15_ltr} shows that the MNase-seq model depicts the characteristic pattern of a \gls{npr} with phased nucleosomes on each side, with a particularly strong effect in ORR subfamilies and a moderate effect in unique sequences. However, this effect is inverted in the chemical cleavage model: phasing in ORR is barely detectable, whereas it appears in unique sequences.

\end{figure}

Among \glspl{ltr}, \gls{iap} elements form a family of rodent-specific endogenous retroviruses. They remain among the most transcriptionally active retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells \cite{dewannieux_identification_2004}, and their regulatory potential has been linked to both physiological and pathological processes. Many \glspl{iap} insertions contain promoter or enhancer sequences capable of driving transcription in a cell type–specific manner, often influencing nearby gene expression. Importantly, \glspl{iap} can act as alternative promoters for host genes or generate novel transcripts, thereby altering chromatin accessibility and local nucleosome organization \cite{sharif_is_2013, elmer_genomic_2021}. The enrichment of \glspl{npr} at \gls{iap} loci in our dataset suggests that these elements may contribute to nucleosome positioning both through their intrinsic sequence composition and by recruiting transcription factors to their LTRs.

IAPEz-int (derived from the Repbase consensus IAPEZI) \cite{Repbase_IAPEZI} is a representative of this rodent-specific \gls{ltr} family. Its size is remarkable ($\sim$7~kb), considering it and the high similarity to the consensus ($>$88\% \cite{Repbase_IAPEZI}) of the repeats, it is expected to highly similar prediction from the model. \Glspl{npr} can be observed at both ends of the sequence (Figure~\ref{fig:iapez_int}). 

Three of these motifs (in addition to motif 40 described in Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme40_ltr}) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme_iapez_subfigs}, motif 44 and 46 are almost exclusively found in IAPEz sequences. Motif 46 show a predicted \gls{npr} on the motif locus for both model whereas sequences carrying motif 44 are predicted unconcordantly for mnase-seq and chemical-cleavage model at the motif site; however the upstream \gls{npr} which correspond to the KLF/SP motif (streme~2 motif, Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme_2}).

These results highlight \glspl{ltr} as strong candidates for sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning. By combining known \gls{tfbs} with constitutive motifs consistently recognized by our model as nucleosome positioning regions, they provide a dual regulatory logic that can shape local chromatin architecture. This suggests that \glspl{ltr} are not only passive remnants of retroviral insertions but active contributors to genome organization, with potential implications for gene regulation in both developmental and evolutionary contexts.

\subsection{ISM reveals constitutive conserved motifs of transposable elements}
The study of the \gls{line} repeats revealed a large variety of motifs on L1 sequences. A characteristic of \glspl{line} is their composition in tandem repeats. Figure~\ref{fig:l1_md_a} shows the density of motifs discovered along the L1Md\_A elements, as expected motifs appear regularly repeated a period of approximately 200b, reflecting the underlying structure.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/xstreme_onrep_seq/L1Md_A_multimot.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{\glspl{npr} on L1Md\_A}. Motifs are sorted by occurrence.}
   \label{fig:l1_md_a}
\end{figure}


Among the recovered motifs, STREME~4 was the most abundant in L1Md\_A. This G-box-like motif was associated with the KLF/SP family. The \textit{de novo} STREME~4 motif matched weakly with KLF17 ($E=9.38e-02$) and KLF4 ($E=6.24e-01$); however, KLF17 was also identified directly in the XSTREME scan ($E=4.68e-605$). Predicted nucleosome occupancy around STREME~4 is consistent across both models, showing an asymmetric pattern: a regularly phased nucleosome array followed by an NPR and a weaker signal toward ORF\textendash3' (Figure~\ref{fig:streme4}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/xstreme_onrep_meta_hm/4-ATACCCACCCACCCC.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{STREME-4 Motif}. 3'-5' oriented}
    \label{fig:streme4}
\end{figure}

Several additional motifs were retrieved (Figure~\ref{fig:streme_motifs_online}). Among them, only motif~52 was clustered by XSTREME with motif~15 (described in the \gls{ltr} section), which is related to the KLF/SP family of binding sites. By contrast, motifs~11, 18, 24, 42, and 51 did not yield significant matches in the JASPAR database. The corresponding position weight matrices show little to no variation across occurrences (Figure~\ref{fig:streme_motifs_online}), and their genomic distribution indicates that they are restricted to \glspl{line}, consistent with strong conservation.

The associated nucleosome landscapes typically show regularly phased nucleosomes, sometimes accompanied by a local decrease in baseline signal. Notably, the predicted landscapes are robust across different LINE~1 subfamilies: for example, motifs~18, 34, and 11 display similar patterns in both L1Md\_A and L1Md\_T. However, motifs~10 and 24 exhibit divergent predictions depending on the subfamily in which they occur.

% While their functional role is not established here, such sequences can sometimes exert biological effects, for instance, by contributing to transcriptional regulation, nucleosome positioning, or higher-order chromatin organization.

Among the motifs retrieved by ISM, several do not correspond to any annotated transcription factor binding site but instead derive from internal regions of transposable elements. Their recovery by ISM suggests that the model is sensitive to these conserved repeat-derived patterns, regardless of whether they act through direct protein binding or other mechanisms.

\FloatBarrier
A prominent example of repeat-associated sequence features was observed in LINE-1 monomers. RepeatMasker annotated three L1Md\_A elements; however, closer inspection revealed that this region contains 35 tandem monomers of 208 bp, corresponding to repeated promoter A units (Appendix~\ref{appendix:L1_monomers}, Figure~\ref{fig:l1_monomer}). Both prediction models identified phased nucleosomes aligned with the monomeric structure, despite low amplitude in the chemical cleavage model predictions. Nucleosome dyads coincide with the monomer repeats, suggesting that sequence periodicity alone can drive nucleosome phasing independently of transcription factor binding.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/L1_monomer_example.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Nucleosome occupancy and ISM score on a L1 element with phased nucleosomes}}
    \label{fig:l1_monomer}
\end{figure}

Although this structure is unlikely to function as a canonical promoter, the periodic organization strongly influences nucleosome phasing: predicted nucleosome dyads align with the monomer repeats, suggesting that specific conserved sequence periodicity, rather than transcription factor binding, can also shape local nucleosome organization. In the context of nucleosome positioning, their regular size and GC-rich sequence (63\%) composition may facilitate the establishment of phased nucleosomes, either by providing sequence-specific anchoring sites or by shaping local DNA physical properties. The presence of these motifs in high-scoring ISM regions may therefore reflect the model’s detection of repeat-derived sequence features that can serve as organizational landmarks in the chromatin landscape.

Together, these findings underscore the ability of LINE-1 elements to shape chromatin architecture not only via transcription factor recruitment but also through intrinsic sequence periodicity and structural DNA features. The ISM approach highlights that repeat-derived motifs, even in the absence of canonical regulatory function, can act as sequence-encoded nucleosome-positioning signals, suggesting a dual role for LINEs as both reservoir of \glspl{tfbs} and chromatin scaffolds.

\FloatBarrier
\section{Local nucleotide enrichment and intrinsic DNA features shape nucleosome organization}
Beyond transposable elements, our genome-wide analysis highlights low-complexity sequence features as recurrent nucleosome-positioning cues. Satellites and simple repeats are over-represented among NPRs (Figure~\ref{fig:volcano_npr_repClass}), and the XSTREME summary (Fig.~\ref{fig:recap_xstreme}) nominates two prototypical motifs—poly(dA{:}dT) and the $(\mathrm{CTCC})_n$ motif as strong shapers of local chromatin architecture. Because these elements are short, abundant, and fully sequence-encoded, they provide a clean testbed to disentangle intrinsic DNA mechanics from protein-mediated effects. In what follows, we focus on these low-complexity tracts to show how they create barrier-like NDRs and phased arrays, and when their effects coincide with specific factor occupancy, thereby linking sequence-encoded cues to nucleosome organization.

\subsection{GC-content is a strong determinant of nucleosome positioning}
Consistent with work in yeast~\cite{meneu_sequence-dependent_2025}, nucleosome occupancy is highest at intermediate GC content. Specifically, for our data the MNase-seq signal peaks between 30–60\% GC, whereas the chemical-cleavage signal shows a broader plateau between 25–70\% GC (Figure~\ref{fig:gc_content_500b}). Voong \emph{et~al.} attribute the attenuation at low GC to MNase bias, which preferentially digests A/T-rich sequences~\cite{voong_genome-wide_2017}. In the same vein, the high-GC shift could be explained by preferential MNase digestion of DNA wrapped around "fragile" nucleosomes, which are frequent near GC-rich \gls{tfbs}, as retrieved by our XSTREME analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:common_scat_xstreme}).
Both assays display a strong decay at the extreme GC values. Conversely, the ISM signal shows two local maxima at the edges of the intermediate-GC range, suggesting specific properties associated with both low- and high-GC sequences.

    \label{fig:gc_content_500b}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adenine arrays have a pivotal role in nucleosome positioning}
Among \gls{npr}, poly-A tandem repeats stand out in the XSTREME analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:recap_xstreme}). Their nucleosomal profile shows a pronounced \gls{ndr} and the presence of a putative fragile nucleosome for the chemical-model, flanked by phased nucleosome arrays (Figure~\ref{fig:polyA_meta}). This pattern is characteristic of the presence of a chromatin barrier, as described by Mavrich et al. \cite{mavrich_barrier_2008}. Both MNase- and Chemical-cleavage–based models consistently show the presence of this barrier, in agreement with previous studies highlighting (A/T)-rich sequences as nucleosome repellent, possibly acting as a chromatin barrier \cite{segal_genomic_2006,mavrich_barrier_2008,zhao_gaa_2015}.

    \caption{\textbf{Aggregated plot of predicted nucleosome occupancy around poly-A microsatellites}. ZNF384 Chip-seq is log10 scaled.}
    \label{fig:polyA_meta}
\end{figure}

TOMTOM analysis further matched the poly-A motif with ZNF384 binding sites. While ZNF384 has been mostly studied in the context of leukemia, recent work highlighted its role in chromatin organization, showing enrichment at \gls{tad} borders and preferential interactions with \gls{sine} elements \cite{vargas_identification_2025}. This makes ZNF384 a compelling candidate as a nucleosome positioning determinant.

When aligning ZNF384 ChIP-seq peaks on the sequences, the nucleosome landscape (Figure~\ref{fig:metachip_znf384}) essentially recapitulates the pattern seen on the general set of poly-A repeats. Importantly, the ZNF384 metaplot does not significantly deviate from the STREME-5 ( $(A)_n$ ) landscape, suggesting that only a subset of high-\gls{ism} poly(dA:dT) tracts are bound by ZNF384, while the positioning property itself is intrinsic to the poly-A DNA sequence.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{\textbf{Aggregated plot of nucleosome occupancy around ZNF384 ChIP-seq peaks}. }
    \label{fig:metachip_znf384}
\end{figure}

Together, these results suggest a dual role of poly-A microsatellites in \gls{mesc}, as effective an \gls{tfbs} for ZNF384, as chromatin barriers due to their intrinsic physical properties.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{G-rich sequences}
In contrast to the poly(A)-rich motifs described in the previous section, which are generally associated with nucleosome-depleted regions, we also investigated poly(dG:dC) sequences. These G-rich sequences are known to adopt non-canonical DNA structures, such as G-quadruplexes \cite{spiegel_structure_2020}, and have been proposed to promote nucleosome formation in certain contexts \cite{collings_effects_2013, masoudi-sobhanzadeh_interpretable_2024, mondo_consecutive_2025}. Among the \textit{de novo} motifs retrieved by XSTREME, one corresponded to a highly repetitive poly(dG:dC) tract and also matched entries in the JASPAR database. This MEME-3 motif ($E=3.20e-154$) corresponds to a poly(dG:dC) tract of 15 bp (Figure~\ref{fig:grich_xstreme}.B). XSTREME clustered it with motifs retrieved directly from the JASPAR scanning: ZNF148 ($E=1.71e-974$), VEZF1 ($E=9.61e-198$), ZNF740 ($E=3.88e-129$), RREB1 ($E=1.27e-030$), and PRDM9 ($E=3.46e-022$) (cluster 136 in Appendix~\ref{appendix:xstreme_list}) for which we didn't find any \gls{chipseq} analysis. The TOMTOM analysis matched MEME-3 with numerous motifs. We report only the signficant one ($E<=5e-2$) in Table~\ref{table:polyG}. As expected from XSTREME clustering, we retrieved motifs VEZF1, ZNF740 and ZNF148 with signifant E-value, however RREB1 and PRDM9 are not significant in the TOMTOM analysis. SP1 and SP4 from the SP/KLF family were also identified, consistent with their known G-box binding motifs.

The effect of this motif on nucleosome landscape is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:grich_xstreme}. The MNase-seq model does not predict a \gls{npr} around the \gls{tfbs}, whereas the chemical cleavage model shows a decrease in signal in the vicinity of the poly-G motif. In both models, however, phased nucleosomes flanking the motif can be observe

\FloatBarrier
The third most recurrent \textit{de novo} motif retrieved in our analysis is also a G-rich motif. STREME-9 is a microsatellite-like motif $\text{CTCCCTCCCTCCCTC}$. This motif clustered with the SP5 \gls{tfbs} from the JASPAR database ($E=6.30e-45$) and also matched SP5 directly with a significant E-value of $5.39e-4$ in TOMTOM analysis. It represents another G-box–like motif but stands out for its peculiar $(CTCC)_n/(GGAG)_n$ composition. Figure~\ref{fig:streme9} shows that, in both models, this motif is associated with an asymmetrical \gls{npr} flanked by phased nucleosome arrays. As expected, the motif is enriched in simple repeats such as microsatellites and G/GA/CT-rich sequences.

These results highlight that simple repeats are not mere genomic noise, but can shape distinct nucleosome landscapes and potentially provide binding sites for transcription factors.

\subsection{Perspective on G4-like motifs}
\gls{g4} are non-canonical nucleic acid structures formed in guanine-rich regions of DNA or RNA. They consist of stacks of guanine tetrads---planar arrangements of four guanine bases connected through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds---stabilized by monovalent cations such as potassium \cite{hoogsteen_crystal_1963}. The canonical sequence motif capable of forming a G-quadruplex is 

\[
\text{G}_{\geq 3}\text{N}_{1\text{--}7}\text{G}_{\geq 3}\text{N}_{1\text{--}7}\text{G}_{\geq 3}\text{N}_{1\text{--}7}\text{G}_{\geq 3}
\]

where $\text{G}_{\geq 3}$ represents a stretch of at least three consecutive guanines and N\textsubscript{1--7} denotes a loop of one to seven arbitrary nucleotides. G-quadruplexes can form in promoter regions, telomeres, and untranslated regions, where they are thought to play regulatory roles in processes such as transcription, replication, and translation.

    \caption{\textbf{Nucleosome occupancy and ISM around G4-like motifs.}Prediction has been made with MNase-seq model on retrieved G4 motif genome wide}
    \label{fig:gquad_meta}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, Figure~\ref{fig:gquad_meta} shows that G4-like motifs are associated with alterations in nucleosome occupancy. Both experimental and predicted MNase-seq profiles exhibit a \gls{ndr} centered on the G4-like motif, consistent with the idea that these structures act as physical or functional barriers to nucleosome positioning. However, no phased nucleosomes can be observed around it.

In addition, the ISM signal peaks sharply at the center of the motif, indicating that the model has learned to associate these sequences with a high-impact disruption of the predicted nucleosome landscape. The strong concordance between experimental data, model predictions, and ISM analysis supports the biological relevance of G4-like motifs as local chromatin organizers.

This chapter reveals that repetitive and low-complexity DNA sequences are not passive genomic passengers, but active participants in chromatin organization. Using \gls{ism} approach, we identified \glspl{sine}, \glspl{line}, \glspl{ltr}, and microsatellites as nucleosome positioning hotspots, each contributing distinct architectural logic.
\begin{itemize}
    \item SINEs (e.g., B2, B3) embed CTCF sites.
    \item LTRs and ERVs encode high-information motifs influencing nucleosome spacing and accessibility.
    \item LINEs exhibit internal sequence periodicity matching nucleosome arrays and provide a reservoir of \gls{tfbs}.
    \item Microsattellites act as chromatin barrier either by their exotic intrinsic physical properties yet still carry potential \glspl{tfbs}.
\end{itemize}

Together, these data suggest a model where genomic repeats double as organizational elements, with functional implications for chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and genome evolution.
\end{tcolorbox}

In this chapter, we demonstrated that convolutional neural networks trained on DNA sequence alone can reproduce \textit{in vivo} nucleosome occupancy profiles with high accuracy. Using MNase-seq and chemical cleavage data, the models achieved correlations up to 0.75 on held-out genomic regions and captured both global occupancy patterns and fine-scale features such as phased arrays around CTCF sites. Importantly, the predictions generalize beyond mappable regions, providing meaningful nucleosome profiles even in repeat-rich domains where experimental signals are degraded. 

Beyond predictive performance, the models internalized both biological determinants of nucleosome organization and the specific biases of the underlying experimental assays. Together, these results show that local sequence context is sufficient to encode much of the nucleosome positioning landscape, while also highlighting limitations linked to long-range chromatin interactions that fall outside the receptive field of our architecture. This chapter therefore establishes the model as a reliable tool for exploring nucleosome positioning genome-wide and provides the foundation for the subsequent motif- and repeat-focused analyses.

\section{Deciphering CTCF motif}
\subsection{ISM highlights robust CTCF motifs}
While CTCF motif is highly represented in the genome, not all its \gls{tfbs} are positioning nucleosomes. Interestingly, the \gls{ism} can discriminate positioning motifs from the CTCF sites without phased nucleosome (Figure~\ref{fig:nuc_on_ctcf_site}). This also correlates with the binding of the protein (Figure~\ref{fig:mut_on_ctcf_site}). As the model can differentiate the behaviour around each site, we can suppose that the binding determinant of CTCF is encrypted in the \gls{dna} sequence. To further investigate the behaviour of the model regarding CTCF motif, we ran \textit{in silico} experiments consisting of mutating CTCF motifs.

The first experiment aimed to probe the model’s focus and better understand how it identifies CTCF motifs. Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_ism_bg} shows the effect of CTCF motifs, selected from the genome, when inserted into different random backgrounds. Each motif was paired with 500 randomly generated background sequences that respect the global GC-content of the mouse genome. CTCF motifs were splitted in two groups using the ISM consensus : CTCF motifs flagged as \gls{npr} (ISM +) and motifs not considered as \gls{npr} (ISM -) (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:methods_of_interpretation}). The heatmaps reveal a clear nucleosome positioning across most backgrounds and motifs for ISM-positive group, in both models. In contrast, positioning fades for ISM-negative motifs, independently of the background. This demonstrates that the model does not only rely on the surrounding sequence context to recognize CTCF, but rather captures a specific sequence-encoded signature intrinsic to the motif itself. On top of that, one can notice that the logoplots differ slightly from each other. For instance, the C at position 19 is more frequent in ISM-tagged motifs, whereas the U-motif at position 1,3,4 are less variable in ISM-low motifs (respectively T, C, A).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/natural_on500bg_ismPlusMinus.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Effect of full motif inserted on random backgrounds regarding their ISM score.}}
    \label{fig:ctcf_ism_bg}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_ism_bg_cluster} shows the clustering of NPscore values by motif and background, using Bray–Curtis distance and the UPGMA algorithm. Both the MNase-seq model (Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_ism_bg_mnase}) and the chemical-cleavage model (Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_ism_bg_chemical}) reveal two distinct clusters of non-positioning CTCF motifs across backgrounds: one with consistently low NPscore on all backgrounds (cluster 1), and another with variable NPscore depending on the background (cluster 2). Interestingly, some CTCF motifs position robustly on any background, but most motifs in cluster 2 show positioning only on specific backgrounds.

\end{figure}

Interestingly, the presence of an \gls{npr} on the motif correlates strongly with nucleosome positioning for the MNase-seq model and more moderately for the chemical mapping (Figure~\ref{fig:ctcf_contingency}). For MNase-seq, cluster 1 is largely depleted of motifs associated with an NPR (35 with NPR vs 286 without), while cluster 2 shows the opposite trend (110 with NPR vs 16 without), yielding a high correlation (MCC = 0.73, Fisher’s exact test $p = 6.4 \times 10^{-55}$). For the chemical cleavage model, the association is weaker but still significant: cluster 1 is again enriched for motifs without NPRs (112 vs 209), whereas cluster 2 contains mostly NPR-associated motifs (124 vs 2), corresponding to a moderate correlation (MCC = 0.57, $p = 8.4 \times 10^{-41}$). Together, these results indicate that the presence of a nucleosome positioning region at CTCF motifs is a strong predictor of positioning in MNase-seq–based models, while chemical cleavage data capture the same trend but with reduced strength.

\subsection{The CTCF upstream motif reinforce CTCF nucleosome phasing ability}
A second experiment was designed to evaluate the impact of the CTCF core motif and its upstream (U) motif on nucleosome organization over a single randomized background. As shown previously and in Figure~\ref{fig:umotif_insertion}, there appear to be two populations of CTCF motifs: one that strongly positions nucleosomes regardless of background, and another whose positioning ability depends on the surrounding sequence. For some motifs, insertion of the core motif alone is sufficient to induce phased nucleosome arrays around the insertion site. Closer inspection of the scatterplots (Figure~\ref{fig:umotif_insertion}B,C) reveals that, on this background, the U-motif has a particularly strong impact on moderately positioning CTCF sites, while it exerts little to no influence on motifs with either very strong or very weak positioning ability.

These results are consistent with the known stabilizing role of the U-motif, which enables CTCF to engage two additional zinc fingers, thereby enhancing its DNA-binding affinity and chromatin residence time \cite{nakahashi_genome-wide_2013}, and potentially reinforcing its barrier effect on nucleosome positioning.

    \label{fig:kmers_synthetics}
\end{figure} 

To better understand how microsatellites can influence nucleosome positioning, we generated synthetic microsatellites as repeated 4-mers (repetitions range from 2 to 14), that we inserted on random backgrounds. The network predictions are consistent across reverse-complementary and cyclically equivalent 4-mers, which are strictly identical when repeated in tandem.
Figure~\ref{fig:kmers_synthetics} shows three representative examples from this experiment. The aggregated signal over background sequences displays no nucleosome positioning pattern. In contrast, the insertion of a single 4-mer in tandem gradually induces a positioning signal, which becomes stronger as the number of repeated monomers increases. However all 4-mers do not have a clear effect on the nucleosome positioning as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aacg}.

Figure~\ref{fig:synth_microsat_content} shows that the NPscore is higher for the extreme values of the GC content of the repeated 4-mers. The result is concordant for both model with few outliers for chemical cleavage model at $50\%$ GC-content. This result confirm what we observed both in experimental data and prediction regarding GC-content: sequences with extreme GC-content values act as chromatin barrier and are flagged as \gls{npr} by both models (Figure~\ref{fig:gc_content_500b}). 

For tandem repeats composed entirely of longer monomers, the relationship with GC content differed, as described in the following section.

    \label{fig:synth_microsat_content}
\end{figure}


\section{Tandem repeats}

Tandem repeats are predominantly located in centromeric and pericentromeric regions \cite{komissarov_tandemly_2011}. Figure~\ref{fig:synth_TR_GC_content} shows the predicted signal amplitude for synthetic tandem repeats of varying monomer sizes and GC contents. The distribution is largely unaffected by monomer size, but strongly dependent on GC content. At extreme values of GC, predictions flatten to low amplitude, particularly in the MNase-seq model. For this model, signals are essentially flat for GC contents above 0.7 and below 0.3. The chemical-cleavage model shows a more moderate decline, with flat profiles at 100\% GC and plateaus for GC contents below 0.2.  

Within the intermediate GC range [0.3–0.6], the distributions are broad: some repeats show strong nucleosome positioning, while others lack any clear positioning signature. Predictions for natural tandem repeats such as minor satellites (MinSat), major satellites (MajSat), and the L1 monomer (Figure~\ref{fig:l1_monomer}) fall toward the lower end of this distribution.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Results/TR_monomer_GC-1.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Amplitude distribution of predicted signal on synthetic and natural tandem repeats}}
    \label{fig:synth_TR_GC_content}
\end{figure}

In summary, although extreme GC contents lead to very restricted amplitude distributions, tandem repeats of varying lengths can nevertheless support a wide range of nucleosome positioning patterns.

    In this chapter, we leveraged the predictive power of our neural network in synthetic settings to probe sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning.  

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \gls{ism} confirmed that the model discriminates between positioning and non-positioning CTCF motifs, and highlighted the stabilizing role of the upstream U-motif in reinforcing nucleosome phasing.
        \item Synthetic microsatellites revealed that extreme GC content generates strong chromatin barrier effects.
        \item Synthetic tandem repeats with longer monomers support diverse nucleosome patterns at intermediate GC content, whereas natural tandem repeats display poor nucleosome positioning.
    \end{itemize}

    Together, these experiments demonstrate that the model captures not only canonical transcription factor binding signals but also intrinsic sequence properties of repetitive DNA. They also illustrate how \glspl{cnn} can be used as an \textit{in silico} sandbox for biological exploration.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks capture complex interplay inside gene-sparse genomes}
We showed that \gls{cnn} can predict nucleosome positioning on large genomes with a fidelity comparable to that observed in gene-dense regions \cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}. At a finer scale, the models reproduced well-established biological features, such as the characteristic nucleosome pattern around acknowledged nucleosome-positioning \gls{tfbs} like CTCF.

Although predicted nucleosome occupancy is less well defined at \gls{tss}, the models were still able to predict a \gls{ndr}. In addition, \gls{npr} were enriched in compartment A, indicating that the models integrate (at least partially) the transcriptional landscape of the cell. While the presence of an \gls{ndr} is required for the transcriptional machinery to initiate transcription, the positioning and dynamics of nucleosomes at \gls{tss} remain unresolved \cite{small_single-cell_2014, chereji_major_2018, wang_dynamic_2022}.

Notably, these studies have shown that average nucleosome occupancy profiles around TSS can obscure substantial gene-to-gene variability. This heterogeneity likely reflects the asynchronous transcriptional states across individual cells in bulk populations, as well as dynamic remodeling processes that are not captured in static measurements. As a result, the apparent "fuzziness" in predicted occupancy around TSS may not necessarily reflect model failure, but rather the biological variability embedded in the training data. Furthermore, the determinants of nucleosome positioning at these loci

\section{Large genomes are punctuated with Nucleosome Positioning Regions}
The \gls{ism} method demonstrated strong robustness, with high correlation between the two models. This approach yielded a sufficient number of precise nucleosome determinants ($\sim$600k), regularly spaced across the genome with an average distance of 4 kb, to account for nucleosome positioning at a genome-wide scale, consistent with the barrier model in large genomes such as mouse \cite{mavrich_barrier_2008}. The study of these \gls{npr} revealed both known \gls{tfbs} and previously uncharacterized motifs, each with the ability to position nucleosomes in their vicinity.

\section{ISM confirms previously identified simple features of nucleosome positioning}
Some di-, tri-, and even tetra-nucleotides were predicted as favoring or disfavoring nucleosome formation \cite{xianfu_nucleosome_2011, giancarlo_epigenomic_2015, masoudi-sobhanzadeh_interpretable_2024}. Here, we demonstrate that locally highly repetitive sequences can act as chromatin barriers and influence nucleosome distribution in their vicinity through their intrinsic nature, particularly regarding their GC content.

We further confirmed previous models indicating poly-A/T arrays as nucleosome-excluding sequences \cite{giancarlo_epigenomic_2015, masoudi-sobhanzadeh_interpretable_2024}, and demonstrated that these sequences act as chromatin barriers—positioning phased arrays of nucleosomes around a \gls{npr}—and that this effect is not linked to the binding of ZNF384. Leveraging synthetic genomics, we generalized this rule by showing that any 4-mer with extreme GC content (0\% or 100\%) acts as a chromatin barrier independently of the surrounding sequence. However, it is important to note that GC-rich sequences correlate with biological features that may influence nucleosome positioning beyond the raw mechanical properties of the DNA itself. Among these are G-quadruplexes, CpG islands, \glspl{tss}, and \glspl{tfbs} such as the G-box of SP/KLF motifs, and in those case we exhibited \gls{ndr} whereas the litterature suggested affinity in GC-rich sequences.

\section{ISM precisely identifies transcription factor binding sites}
Beyond these simple features, we identified canonical \gls{tfbs} as nucleosome positioning factors. The KLF/SP family appears as a novel nucleosome-positioning factor \textit{in vivo}. While the precise transcription factor bound at each occurrence cannot be unambiguously inferred from sequence alone, the strong similarity to well-characterized factors such as KLF4 supports the idea that pioneer-like properties underlie this positioning activity. These observations place SP/KLF-like motifs among the recurrent sequence features that shape nucleosome landscapes. Notably, this nucleosome organization mirrors that observed at KLF4 binding sites in mouse embryonic stem cells, where KLF4 binding is compatible with nucleosome occupancy at the motif itself and leads to phasing of adjacent nucleosomes. The recovery of this motif by Soufi et al. in \textit{in vitro} pioneer factor binding assays \cite{soufi_pioneer_2015} further supports the notion that G-box KLF/SP sites can serve as anchoring points for nucleosome positioning.
Although the KLF/SP family is widely associated with GC-rich binding motifs, its direct contribution to nucleosome phasing \textit{in vivo} has remained poorly documented. Our results provide indirect yet robust evidence that these motifs actively contribute to phased arrays of nucleosomes, thus extending their role beyond canonical transcriptional regulation.

Beyond KLF/SP, our analyses retrieved additional motifs. Both \textit{de novo} discovery and JASPAR-guided searches consistently recovered Thap11 (Ronin) and Dux, two factor that are still poorly described in the context of nucleosome positioning but acknowledged as essential mouse development factors, involved in pluripotency \cite{dejosez_ronin_2008, ren_dux_2022}, alongside a collection of well-established pluripotency regulators, including YY1, Nanog, Oct4, Sox family members, and the Oct4:Sox2 heterodimer \cite{tyagi_chromatin_2016, festuccia_transcription_2019}. These observations underscore how deeply the interplay between nucleosome positioning and DNA sequence is embedded within the regulatory network of embryonic stem cells, to the point that the architecture alone is able to capture essential determinants of pluripotency.

Taken together, the influence of local sequences and transcription factors further confirms a duality in nucleosome-positioning rules. The sequence itself positions nucleosomes, but this influence can be overcome by external factors such as \gls{dna}-binding proteins, higher-order chromatin folding, or chromatin remodelers.

\subsection{CTCF has a unique dynamic yet encoded in its motif}
In line with numerous reports of its ability to shape chromatin and displace nucleosomes \cite{teif_nucleosome_2014,nichols_ctcf_2015,ghirlando_ctcf_2016, clarkson_ctcf-dependent_2019, festuccia_transcription_2019}, CTCF was strongly and recurrently recovered in our sequence analyses. Strikingly, the models could discriminate DNA-bound CTCF sites with high precision, suggesting that \glspl{nn} may help resolve such challenging loci and extend predictive scope beyond nucleosome positioning to broader protein–DNA interactions.

Unlike Romero \textit{et al.}, who inferred binding preferences by training directly on TF-specific ChIP-seq data \cite{romero_tfscope_2024}, our approach identifies such determinants indirectly from nucleosome landscapes. This demonstrates that interpretable models trained on chromatin organization can recover generalizable regulatory logic, rather than being restricted to single datasets or factors.

Synthetic genomics reinforced these findings by revealing the importance of the U\-motif in B3 SINE–derived CTCF \glspl{tfbs}, which is absent from B2\_Mm2 SINEs despite both carrying a CTCF core motif \cite{schmidt_waves_2012}. Schmidt \textit{et al.} linked this compositional difference to evolutionary age, with B3 elements predating B2 \cite{schmidt_waves_2012, vassetzky_analysis_2021}. Our results are consistent with a loss of the U-motif in murine B2 while it has been retained in B3. Since both core motifs are represented by the same \gls{pwm}, this highlights intra-motif dependencies invisible to conventional motif models and points to a scenario of parallel evolution between B3 and B2\_Mm2.

A key determinant of CTCF function is its residence time, which depends on the protein’s ability to engage its eleven zinc fingers \cite{soochit_ctcf_2021}. The upstream auxiliary motif enables binding of additional fingers, thereby extending residence time \cite{yang_structures_2023}. This may in turn relax selective pressure on the core motif, providing an evolutionary explanation for the divergence observed between B2\_Mm2 and B3 SINEs while preserving overall CTCF occupancy.

This hypothesis of coexisting CTCF configurations is also consistent with the observation that the consensus motif alone poorly predicts \glspl{tad} borders. Because CTCF competes with other transcription factors that recognize highly similar motifs \cite{kaaij_chahp_2019, wang_adnp_2024}, even subtle motif variations or intra-motif nucleotide dependencies may be functionally relevant—an aspect that our network appears to capture.

Finally, CTCF motifs found in unique genomic regions coexist as both solo-core and U+core variants. Whether these motifs ultimately derive from ancient \glspl{sine} remains an open question. Nonetheless, our networks prove capable of detecting repeated-element–derived motifs with high sensitivity and thus hold promise for addressing broader evolutionary questions on the origin and diversification of regulatory sequences. In this sense, interpretable neural networks may open a new path beyond consensus-based annotations, offering a dynamic way to trace the evolutionary logic of regulatory sequences

\subsection{Deep investigation of transposable elements reveals nucleosome positioning regions}
The ability of deep learning to overcome mappability limitations allowed us to extend our analysis to repeated elements. Beyond the well-described CTCF-harboring \glspl{sine}, we highlighted the contribution of \glspl{ltr}, which are known regulators and, as shown here, also act as nucleosome-positioning sequences. \Glspl{line} elements not only carry established \glspl{tfbs}, but also harbor conserved motifs without clear database matches, which nevertheless colocalize with regularly phased nucleosome arrays.

These observations align with the recognized role of repeats in shaping chromatin structure at large genomic scales \cite{cournac_3d_2016}, while also underscoring their regulatory impact when co-opted as cis-regulatory elements \cite{chuong_regulatory_2017}. For transposable elements that are normally repressed, nucleosomes provide a first line of defense by bearing repressive epigenetic marks and preventing their activation. Yet, their numerous embedded \glspl{tfbs} and promoters remain poised to enter regulatory networks if silencing is relaxed, for instance through the loss of repressive methylation \cite{pelinski_nf-b_2022}. In this sense, nucleosome positioning emerges both as a mechanism of genome stability and as a substrate for regulatory innovation.

Whether recruited into regulatory circuits or silenced as genomic parasites, our results show that transposable elements consistently act as nucleosome-positioning factors. They should therefore be regarded not merely as passive passengers, but as active architectural players in the organization of the chromatin landscape.

\subsection{Simple repeats but active chromatin shaping actors}
In the absence of external factors, nucleosomes tend to position according to sequence preferences. Our synthetic microsatellite experiments confirmed this principle: short tandem repeats with extreme GC content acted as strong chromatin barriers, robustly inducing phased nucleosome patterns. In contrast, natural tandem repeats in the genome showed only weak phasing compared to synthetic constructs. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of genomic repeats, which may balance opposing sequence signals within their monomers, be shaped by higher-order chromatin contexts absent from synthetic settings, or be blurred by technical challenges such as mapping ambiguities in highly repetitive regions. Together, these observations suggest that synthetic assays expose the “pure” sequence rules of nucleosome positioning, whereas natural repeats reveal how such rules are modulated in vivo. Further work will be required to disentangle these possibilities.

It is still important to remind that we found putative \glspl{tfbs} on microsatellites and even cross poly-As track with ZNF380 chip-seq, showing that they can also engage in interaction with proteins. Moreover some studies suggest that microsatellites would be transcribed \cite{grapotte_discovery_2021}, which would match the nucleosome patterns observed in the vicinity of simple repeats. Thus, microsatellites should not be viewed merely as passive sequence oddities: their exotic base composition shapes nucleosome organization, while their ability to recruit proteins or even undergo transcription highlights their potential as active regulatory actors within the chromatin landscape.

\section{Where models agree, biology emerges}
Strikingly, our independently trained neural networks show stronger agreement with each other than with the experimental signals they were trained on, even though these datasets were designed to capture the same biological phenomenon—nucleosome positioning—using MNase-seq and chemical cleavage performed in different laboratories. This effect was also observed on natural L1-\glspl{tr}, where nucleosomes were consistently phased between predictions.

This observation suggests that deep learning models can extract the underlying biological signal beyond experimental noise, effectively acting as a denoising layer. More broadly, it highlights that the mere accumulation of large-scale data is not sufficient: progress will also require the multiplication of complementary sources, ensuring that predictive models are anchored in reproducible biology rather than experimental artifacts.

\section{Limits and perspectives}
Although our study was trained on experimental data from different laboratories, most conclusions rely on statistical computation or \textit{in silico} experiments. A first limitation is that the two datasets were used separately for training. A unified model trained jointly on both would likely converge toward a shared set of weights, capturing generalizable features while minimizing dataset-specific biases. For example, fragile nucleosomes are robustly captured in chemical cleavage but erased in MNase-seq, and our models reproduce this difference. A unified model trained jointly on both assays may help reconcile such discrepancies, disentangling genuine biology from assay-specific biases.

A second limitation lies in the 2,001-bp receptive field of our networks. While some long-range effects may be partially encoded in local sequence features (e.g., repeated elements or CTCF motifs acting as TAD borders), higher-order chromatin interactions or distal regulatory mechanisms remain inaccessible to the current model. Addressing this will require extending input lengths, integrating external contact maps and multi-omics data, or developing new representations of chromatin beyond the primary DNA sequence.

A third limitation concerns motif discovery. Tools such as STREME, MEME, and the broader XSTREME suite depend on statistical enrichment relative to background models, making them sensitive to the choice of controls and compositional biases. Moreover, their reliance on \glspl{pwm} assumes positional independence and cannot capture higher-order dependencies or DNA structural features. As emphasized by the authors of these methods, enrichment-based motif discovery is intrinsically constrained by data resolution and by the presence of repetitive or low-complexity regions, which may inflate significance or obscure meaningful motifs. Reported motifs should therefore be interpreted cautiously and ideally validated with orthogonal experimental approaches \cite{bailey_streme_2021}.

A fourth limitation is the cell-type specificity of our training data. Because the models were trained exclusively on mouse embryonic stem cells, some extracted features may reflect stem-cell–specific determinants of chromatin organization rather than universal nucleosome-positioning principles. Predictions on synthetic constructs, in particular, may not directly transfer across cell types with different remodeler activity or regulatory programs. Future studies should evaluate model generalizability across diverse contexts and species.

Finally, new nucleosome mapping techniques—especially long-read and single-cell approaches—offer promising avenues to overcome current limitations. By resolving dynamic aspects of chromatin organization and mitigating short-read mapping biases, these emerging datasets could be integrated with deep learning models to provide a more complete and mechanistic understanding of nucleosome positioning.

\section{Conclusion}
As biology becomes as computational as it is experimental, progress will increasingly depend on the integration of expertise across disciplines, as recent studies demonstrate \cite{zhou_borzoi_2024, sun_hi-compass_2025}. Machine learning is not a replacement for \textit{in vivo} experimentation, but rather an \textit{in silico} sandbox in which hypotheses can be generated, prioritized, and explored at low marginal cost. By recovering biological signal from noisy data, such approaches complement experimental work. This thesis illustrates how interpretable deep learning can reproduce established principles of chromatin organization while uncovering novel determinants of nucleosome positioning, providing both mechanistic insight and experimentally testable predictions.

\section{Architectures}
Two \gls{cnn} architectures were implemented to predict nucleosome occupancy profiles from DNA sequence, inspired by previous work \cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}. The final choice of architectures, however, was guided by empirical testing.
\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{CNN\_simple5H}] A lightweight architecture designed for general nucleosome occupancy prediction. It consists of three consecutive convolutional blocks with ReLU activation (32 filters each, kernel sizes 3, 10, and 20bp), each followed by max-pooling (pool size~2) and batch normalization. The convolutional stack is flattened and passed through a dense layer (8 units, ReLU) with batch normalization, before the final output layer (5 sigmoid units corresponding to the 5 output positions).
    
    \item[\textbf{Chemical\_5H}] A deeper, higher-capacity model optimised for chemical cleavage data. This variant uses more filters in the first convolution (256 filters, kernel size~5bp) followed by two convolutional layers (64 filters, kernel sizes 11 and 21bp). Each convolution is followed by max-pooling (pool size~2) and batch normalization. As in CNN\_simple5H, the flattened output is fed into a dense layer (8 units, ReLU) with batch normalization, then to the final 5-unit sigmoid output layer.
\end{description}

\subsection{Loss function and metrics}
The models were trained to minimize a custom loss function as described in Routhier \textit{et al.} work, combining the mean absolute error (MAE) and the complement of the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted ($\hat{y}$) and observed ($y$) nucleosome occupancy \cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = \mathrm{MAE}(y, \hat{y}) + \left( 1 - r(y, \hat{y}) \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{MAE}(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    r(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})(\hat{y}_i - \overline{\hat{y}})}
    {\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - \overline{\hat{y}})^2}} .
\end{equation}
The metrics reported during training and evaluation were the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ and the MAE.

\subsection{Target value reweighting}
To ensure that all predicted occupancy values in the range $[0,1]$ contributed equally to the loss, we applied a bin-wise reweighting strategy. The continuous interval $[0,1]$ was divided into $100$ equal-width bins. For each bin $b$, the weight $w_b$ was set inversely proportional to its frequency in the training set:
\begin{equation}
    w_b = \frac{1}{f_b}
\end{equation}
where $f_b$ is the fraction of training samples with target values in bin $b$. Each sample's contribution to the loss was then multiplied by the weight corresponding to its bin. This procedure compensates for imbalanced occupancy value distributions and prevents over-representation of highly frequent bins.

\subsection{Number of heads}
To stabilize the interpretation of the neural network, predictions were made at five positions along the input sequence: 501, 751, 1001, 1251, and 1501.
Figure~\ref{fig:nbhead_mut} shows that the signal-to-noise ratio of the ISM score varies depending on the number of output heads.
The best ratio is observed with an architecture using 21 heads.
However, using 5 heads offers a good compromise between ISM score stability and the computational cost induced by the number of outputs.

\end{figure}

\section{Training strategy}

\subsection{Low-covered sequences disrupt CNN training}
The main principle of any neural network is to fit the provided data. Keeping this in mind, it is crucial to carefully choose that data. In our work, we faced a challenge: the genome is largely composed of repeated elements, and mapping short reads results in ambiguous signals. To approach the biological truth of nucleosome positioning, we decided to use only reads with a unique mapping location. This process yields a nucleosome map with signal-depleted regions. To assess the performance of the network on this region we used a second signal issued from the same reads; the ambiguous mapping genes have been randomly mapped between the matching positions.

The training of the network is directly correlated with the selected windows for the training. It is neither possible to suppress totally the repeats, neither to include them. To assess the impact of low-coverage regions on model performance, we compared predictions obtained with the standard training procedure to those obtained after excluding low-coverage sequences. The threshold to exclude a window from the training set is 20 midpoints over the 2kb window. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lowcov_hist}, filtering out such regions leads to a clearer agreement between experimental and predicted distributions. Notably, the network is able to produce high predicted values (above 0.8) which were absent in the standard training condition. This indicates that low-coverage regions introduce uncertainty into the predictions, limiting the model's ability to fully capture the signal distribution.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Results/training low coverage.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Comparison between the training strategies regarding the coverage}}
    \label{fig:lowcov_hist}
\end{figure}
  
\subsection{Subsampling the signal}

To estimate the amount of information contained in the MNase-seq data, we randomly subsampled the experimental signal at fractions ranging from 10 to 70\% and assessed the impact on prediction quality (Figure~\ref{fig:subsampling}A). More specifically, we quantified the effect on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the dissimilarity between two distributions. As expected, the dissimilarity increased with the degree of subsampling.

We then fitted the empirical KL divergence values as a function of the subsampling fraction using a non-linear least-squares regression implemented in \texttt{scipy}, with \texttt{curve\_fit}. The fitting function \texttt{logfit} was initialized with parameters $[2, 1, -0.2]$, and the optimization returned the best-fitting parameters along with their covariance estimates (Figure~\ref{fig:subsampling}B).

The extrapolation suggests that inflating the MNase-seq dataset by 400\% would yield a null divergence. This conclusion, however, has important limitations. First, the experiment was performed without applying the coverage correction, which we showed to substantially improve model performance. Second, MNase-seq is subject to GC-bias, meaning that increasing sequencing depth could add redundant reads without providing additional information.

Nevertheless, these results indicate that our current MNase-seq data have not yet reached saturation, as there is no subsampling fraction at which information loss becomes negligible.

\chapter{Datasets and Methods}
\label{appendix:methods_of_interpretation}

\section{MNase-sequencing}
The nucleosomal landscape of mice embryonic stem cells has been obtained from MNase-sequencing\cite{festuccia_transcription_2019} and is available under accession number GSE122589 (GEO; \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}). The signal has been processed by Pablo Navarro's team in Institut Pasteur, notably by Luis Altamirano which provided the position of fragment midpoint (paired-end sequencing). The signal has then been constructed by performing a gaussian convolution of parameters $\mu=1, \sigma=15$ and truncating the signal with the 99th centile to get rid of the outliers values before normalizing it in [0-1].
\subsection{Processing}
\subsubsection{Gaussian Kernel Construction}
The Gaussian kernel is defined as a discrete approximation of the continuous Gaussian function, parameterized by the standard deviation \(\sigma\) and mean \(\mu\). The function is constructed over a symmetric range \([-3\sigma, 3\sigma]\) using the formula:
\begin{equation}
    G(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Normalization}
The preprocessing function applies the Gaussian convolution $G$  to smooth the input signal. After convolution, a quantile-based thresholding is applied: the values are clipped at the $99-th$ quantile and then normalized between 0 and 1. Formally, given an input signal \( S \), the transformed signal is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{S} = \frac{\min(S', \tau)}{\tau}, \quad \text{where } S' = S * G, \quad \tau = Q_{99th}(S')
\end{equation}
where \( * \) denotes convolution, and \( Q_{99th}(S') \) represents the \textbf{99-th quantile} of the convolved signal.



\section{Chemical cleavage}
\subsection{Processing}
The Nucleosome Organization in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells has been obtained from Chemical cleavage\cite{voong_insights_2016} and is available under accession number GSE82127 (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). These data were originally mapped to the mm9 assembly. We used the UCSC LiftOver tool \cite{hinrichs_ucsc_2006} together with the provided mm9-to-mm10 chain file to remap the data to the mm10 assembly, which was used throughout the study.
The nucleosome occupancy were computed as described: position \( k \) was calculated as the sum of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) scores over 
a local window centered on \( k \), where \( S_{k+j} \) represents the NCP score at position \( k + j \). 
Additionally, the center-weighted occupancy at position \( k \) was computed using a Gaussian 
weighting function:
\[
w_j = \exp\left(-\frac{(j/20)^2}{2}\right)
\]

This center-weighted approach results in a smoothed version of the NCP score, which helps refine nucleosome boundary identification.

\section{In silico Mutagenesis}
Following the mutasome approach \cite{routhier_genome-wide_2021}, Given a set of nucleotides $B = {A, C, G, T}$ each single mutation is performed genome wide (3 possible mutations per position) and the result of the prediction is compared to the wild type sequence result using mean squared error. A mutascore is attributed to each position $P$ such as 
\begin{equation}
    Mutascore = \underset{B-Bp}{\sum} \frac{MSE(Pred(b), Pred(Bp))}{3}.
\end{equation}

with
\begin{equation}
    MSE(\hat{Y}, Y) = \frac{1}{N}\underset{n=1}{\sum}(\hat{Y}_n - Y_n)^2
\end{equation}

The deliberate choice to use only the $MSE$ to score the difference comes from the number of output head of the \gls{cnn}: Performing the pearson correlation on 5 points can lead to noisy results and bad evaluation of the site.

\subsection{Nucleosome Positioning Regions calling for sequence analysis}
The motif discovery was performed on consensus peaks between MNase-seq and chemical cleavage. Specifically, we selected ISM peaks that were retrieved in both chemical-cleavage \gls{ism} and MNase-seq \gls{ism}. Both signals were z-scored and subsequently smoothed using a rolling mean with a window size of 12. The two signals were then multiplied element-wise to highlight correlated regions, and peaks were called using scipy.signal.find\_peaks with a prominence threshold of 1, yielding a set of Nucleosome Positioning Regions (NPRs).

Because the input windows were generated using a sliding procedure, fewer than 7\% of sequences overlapped by at least 1 bp (Figure~\ref{fig:nprs_distance}). The MEME/XSTREME framework tolerates such redundancy; the main effect is a potential inflation of significance estimates due to reduced sequence independence, without altering the identity of enriched motifs \cite{bailey_meme_2009}. We therefore interpret the reported p-values/E-values with caution.


\section{MEME suite}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/methods/xstreme_pipeline.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Graphical abstract of the pipeline used for sequence analysis.} Adapted from the Motif-based Sequence Analysis Tools (\url{https://meme-suite.org/meme/index.html}).}
    \label{fig:xstreme_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{XSTREME analysis}

De novo motif discovery was performed using \textbf{XSTREME} \cite{bailey_streme_2021}, 
part of the MEME suite. XSTREME identifies enriched motifs in input sequences by combining 
multiple algorithms (MEME, STREME, and motif clustering; Figure~\ref{fig:xstreme_pipeline}) 
and by comparing the results to known motif databases. For our analysis, we used the set of 
nucleosome positioning regions (NPRs) as input and ran XSTREME with the JASPAR 2024 vertebrate 
non-redundant database (in MEME format) as reference motifs \cite{rauluseviciute_jaspar_2024}, and an E-value threshold of 
\(1 \times 10^{-5}\). By default, the background model was estimated from the input sequences 
using \texttt{fasta-get-markov} with a Markov order of \(k=2\).

\subsection{Motif filtering with SEA}
We used the \textbf{Sequence Enrichment Analysis (SEA)} tool from the MEME suite 
to assess motif enrichment within our set of nucleosome positioning regions (NPRs). 
SEA evaluates whether known motifs occur more frequently in the input sequences than in 
a background model, providing statistical significance (E-value) and site-level scores. 
This approach is particularly suited to validate de novo motifs and to connect them with 
previously described transcription factor binding sites.

Motif instances reported by SEA were then subjected to additional filtering in order to retain 
only high-confidence sites:  

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each motif, we retrieved its consensus sequence and effective length 
    from the \texttt{sea.tsv} output.  
    \item We normalized the raw SEA site score by motif length, yielding a 
    \textit{normalized score}.  
    \item Only motif instances with a normalized score $\geq 1$ were kept.  
    \item Motifs not overlapping with the subset of XSTREME-filtered motifs 
    ($E$-value $\leq 0.01$; MEME/STREME source only) were discarded to ensure 
    consistency between de novo and enrichment analyses.  
\end{itemize}

The resulting set, hereafter referred to as \textbf{full\_sea\_filtered}, represents the 
intersection between de novo motif discovery (XSTREME) and enrichment analysis (SEA), 
restricted to high-confidence motif instances with sufficient normalized score. This dataset 
was used as the input for subsequent overlap analyses with RepeatMasker annotations.

\subsection{Enrichment of NPRs in repetitive-element families.}
Let $G$ denote the genomic coordinate space used as the background, here the whole reference genome without undefined bases (N). 
For each repeat family $f$, let $\mathcal{I}_f=\{I_{f,1},\dots,I_{f,m_f}\}$ be the set of its annotated intervals and $U_f=\bigcup_{k=1}^{m_f} I_{f,k}$ their union (non-overlapping). 
We write $|A|$ for the length (in bp) of a set of intervals $A$ and define the family coverage fraction
\[
\phi_f \;=\; \frac{|U_f|}{|G|}\, .
\]

Let $\{J_1,\dots,J_n\}$ be the set of NPRs and $L=\mathbb{E}[|J_i|]$ their mean length. 
We discretize $G$ into $N=\big\lfloor |G|/L \big\rfloor$ non-overlapping bins of length $L$. 
Under the null hypothesis that NPRs are placed uniformly at random over $G$, the number of bins intersecting family $f$ is $K_f \approx \phi_f N$, and the number of NPRs that intersect $U_f$ by at least one base,
\[
x_f \;=\; \big|\{\,i\in\{1,\dots,n\}: J_i \cap U_f \neq \varnothing \,\}\big| ,
\]
is modelled by a right-tailed hypergeometric distribution,
\[
X_f \,\sim\, \mathrm{Hypergeom}(N,\, K_f,\, n), 
\qquad 
p_f \;=\; \Pr\!\big[X_f \ge x_f \,\big|\, N,K_f,n\big] .
\]
We compute $p_f$ numerically using the log survival function for stability (SciPy: \texttt{hypergeom.logsf}).\\


Let $m$ be the number of families tested. 
We control the false discovery rate at level $\alpha$ using the Benjamini--Hochberg (BH) step-up procedure. 
Writing the $p$-values in ascending order $p_{(1)} \le \cdots \le p_{(m)}$, the BH $q$-values are
\[
q_{(i)} \;=\; \min_{j\ge i} \frac{m}{j}\, p_{(j)} \quad (i=1,\dots,m),
\]
with the usual monotonicity enforcement; in practice we implement this entirely in log-space to avoid underflow. 
For visualization we plot $-\log_{10}(q_f)$ on the $x$-axis (higher $\Rightarrow$ more significant); the vertical reference line corresponds to the chosen FDR threshold, e.g. $-\log_{10}(0.01)=2$ for $1\%$ FDR. 
On the $y$-axis we display the family size ("All Count"), and use a logarithmic scale for readability. 
The $x$-axis uses a symmetric log transform to display both small and very large values.

The assumptions and scope so that this formulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item uses the union coverage $\phi_f$ to account for heterogeneous repeat lengths and overlaps;
    \item treats NPRs as independent draws on a uniform background of bins of size $L$
    \item counts NPRs by occurrence (''touches $\ge1$~bp''), not by overlap length. Edge effects due to binning are negligible at the chosen resolution and do not affect our qualitative conclusions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Wavelet analysis}
The Wavelet analysis were performed using PyWavelet python package \cite{lee_pywavelets_2019}. A complex Morlet wavelet is used and scaled to correspond to periods ranging from 150bp to 200bp in steps of 10bp. The wavelet is slid across the signal, producing higher values when the signal closely matches the wavelet.The resulting score is calculated as the sum of the magnitudes (modules) of these values (~Figure\ref{fig:wavelet_principle}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{Figures/Results/wavelet_principle.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Principle of wavelet analysis.} The wavelet (blue: real part, orange: imaginary part, green:module) is slid across the signal (top), The resulting score (bottom) is calculated as the sum of the magnitudes (modules)}
    \label{fig:wavelet_principle}
\end{figure}

Nucleosome island are called using scipy.signal.find\_peaks package with prominence of 4. \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}.

\section{Repeated elements}
Annotation of repeated elements was performed using RepeatMasker \cite{smit_afa_hubley_r_green_p_repeatmasker_1996}.  The annotation table is available on the UCSC Genome Browser (\url{https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=mm10&hgta_group=varRep&hgta_track=rmsk&hgta_table=rmsk}). The reference library of repetitive elements used for the annotation was Repbase \cite{bao_repbase_2015}.

\section{ChIP-seq}
ChIP-seq of CTCF has been provided by Navarro's team from the Institut Pasteur\cite{festuccia_transcription_2019, owens_ctcf_2019}

ChIP-seq of ZNF384 is available available on Encode under the accession ENCFF043AHA

\section{G-quadruplex}
Putative G-quadruplex prediction on mm10 was performed using g4predict (Matthew Parker, GitHub repository, \url{https://github.com/mparker2/g4predict} \cite{g4predict}.

\section{Micro-C}
Micro-C data are available under GEO accession \texttt{GSE130275} \cite{hsieh_resolving_2020}. Micro-c compartments were computed using SCN normalization, as described by Cournac \textit{et al.} \cite{cournac_normalization_2012}, using a 50kb bin size.

\section{Transcription Start Sites}
Coordinates of transcription start sites (TSS) were obtained from the \textbf{EPDnew} database \cite{dreos_eukaryotic_2017}, which provides a manually curated collection of experimentally validated promoters in eukaryotes. Each entry in EPDnew corresponds to a promoter region anchored at a high-confidence TSS, supported by high-throughput transcript mapping data (e.g. CAGE, RAMPAGE). The database is regularly updated to reflect current genome assemblies and integrates information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.  

For our analysis, we downloaded the \texttt{epdNewPromoter} table for the mouse genome (assembly mm10) using the UCSC Table Browser (\url{https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables}; group: regulation, track: epdNew, table: epdNewPromoter). This dataset provides strand-specific TSS positions with additional annotation fields, and was used as the reference set of promoters in our study.

 Only TSS located on chromosome~1 were considered for the analysis shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tss_nucpos_chr19}. The dataset was stratified by strand orientation: for the positive strand, the annotated start coordinate was used; for the negative strand, the annotated end coordinate was taken. For each TSS, we extracted a $\pm 2$~kb window relative to the start coordinate. On the positive strand, this corresponds to positions $[TSS - 2000, \; TSS + 2000]$, while on the negative strand the same interval was extracted in reverse orientation to maintain a consistent 5'–3' transcriptional direction. 

To characterize local nucleosome phasing, we computed the autocorrelation function of experimental nucleosome profiles within each TSS-centered window. For each profile, the lag corresponding to the maximum autocorrelation was identified in the range 100–500~bp, corresponding to expected nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL). Only windows with clear phasing, defined as having optimal lags between 170 and 230bp, were retained for downstream analysis. This deliberate filtering ensured that subsequent analyses focused on TSS showing well-positioned nucleosomal arrays, thereby facilitating robust comparisons between experimental and predicted signals.

\section{Saliency}
We computed base-resolution saliency maps to attribute the model’s predictions to input sequence positions. We loaded the trained TensorFlow/Keras model and removed the final sigmoid activation by reconstructing the last dense layer with a linear activation, keeping all weights identical. Gradients were then computed with respect to one-hot encoded DNA input (A/C/G/T channels).

For an input batch $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times 4}$ and a target output unit (class index) $c$, we used 
\texttt{tf.GradientTape} to obtain
\[
\nabla_X \hat{y}_c = \frac{\partial \hat{y}_c}{\partial X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times 4}.
\]
Per-position, per-example saliency was defined as the channel-summed absolute gradient after channel–mean centering,
\[
S(b,\ell) \;=\; \sum_{k=1}^{4} \left| \nabla_X \hat{y}_c(b,\ell,k) \;-\; \frac{1}{4}\sum_{k'=1}^{4}\nabla_X \hat{y}_c(b,\ell,k') \right|,
\]
yielding \(S \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L}\).

\section{Data visualization}
For data visualization, unless otherwise specified, sequences were oriented in the 5'–3' direction, using the reverse complement when necessary. In the same vein, repeated elements were aligned using RepeatMasker annotations: all instances were reoriented to match the consensus sequence, and their positions were expressed relative to the consensus, accounting for possible truncations.

\section{Synthetic microsatellites}
One thousand non-overlapping 3~kb-long sequences with low \gls{ism} scores were randomly selected as background. The test motifs used to simulate microsatellites consisted of all possible 4-mers (256 in total), each inserted as tandem repeats with a number of monomer units ranging from 2 to 14 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14). Predictions were performed for all combinations, yielding $256 \times 7 \times 1000$ synthetic observations.
